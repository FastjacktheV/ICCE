Why First::fun is called
    If we don't explicitly tell the compiler in which namespace to look
    for fun(), it will use the namespace of the argument given to fun().
    This is called Koenig lookup.
How to call Second::fun
    By explicitly writing Second::fun(enist); in main
Why << is simplified by Koenig lookup

Why fun(First::Enum symbol) fails
    The compiler is looking for fun() in the namespace First::Enum. 
    Since the function fun() is not there, WC.
