<h1>Chapter 7: Exercises set seven: Basic Input/Output. Deadline: November 2</h1>

        <strong>Exercise 52.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to create a `one-size-fits-all' function
<p>
Consider the following <code>main</code> function:
        </p><pre>
int main()
{
    fun();
    fun("with functions");
    fun(1, 2, 3);
}
        
</pre>

    This function does not compile, <code>fun</code> hasn't been declared.
<p>
Add one function <em>declaration</em> to the above source text so that <code>main</code>
<em>can</em> be compiled. Submit the modified source.
</p><p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    Use a function with the ellipsis as parameter, since that's the
`universal' parameter list. This source file compiles flawlessly:
        </p><pre>
void fun(...);

int main()
{
    fun();
    fun("with functions");
    fun(1, 2, 3);
}
        
</pre>

    One problem remains (but that's not part of the exercise): inside <code>fun</code>
you have no idea how <code>fun</code> was called, and so you can't access its
arguments. That problem will be solved later in this course.
<p>

        <strong>Exercise 53.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose: learn to understand the behavior of istreams.
<p>
Consider the following little program:
        </p><pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;sstream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    if (argc &gt; 3)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "Require two numerical unsigned inputs" &lt;&lt; '\n';
        return 1;
    }
     
    istringstream istr(argv[1]);
    size_t no1 = 0;
    istr &gt;&gt; no1;
  
    cout &lt;&lt; "extracted first number: " &lt;&lt; no1 &lt;&lt; '\n';

    istr.str(argv[2]);
    size_t no2 = 0;
    istr &gt;&gt; no2;
  
    cout &lt;&lt; "extracted second number: " &lt;&lt; no2 &lt;&lt; '\n';
}

</pre>

<p>
Run this program and provide two numeric arguments, e.g., <code>a.out 1
2</code>. Explain why the output is not 
        </p><pre>
    extracted first number: 1
    extracted second number: 2
        
</pre>

    and provide the required repair (no need to sumbit all of the code, just
provide the repair and some of the surrounding lines, so I can see where the
repair fits in).
<p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    When extracting the first number, extraction succeeds, but at the same
time <code>istr.eof()</code> is true. Even though <code>istr</code>'s buffer is reassigned a
value, this doesn't clear the flags. An explicit <code>istr.clear()</code> is needed to
clear that flag, which will then allow <code>istr</code> to extract the second number.
</p><p>
The repair is:
        </p><pre>
    ...
    istr &gt;&gt; no1;
    cout &lt;&lt; "extracted first number: " &lt;&lt; no1 &lt;&lt; '\n';

    istr.clear();           // put this somewhere between the two extractions
    istr.str(argv[2]);
    ...
        
</pre>

<p>
<br><br>
    
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 54.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose: learn to define a manipulator
<p>
Many situations exist where the current local time must be displayed. The <strong>C</strong>
function <code>asctime</code> can be used for that, but its use isn't
trivial. Moreover, <code>asctime</code> automatically appends a trailing newline to the
returned time, which we may not want.
</p><p>
Define and submit a <em>manipulator</em> <code>now</code> inserting the current date and
time as produced by <code>asctime</code> but without the trailing newline. To use it,
your should be able to do:
        </p><pre>
    int main()
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; now &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
        
</pre>

<p>
Submit the implementation of the <code>now</code> manipulator and an example of its
output. All code (including the above <code>main</code> function) may be submitted in
one source file.
</p><p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    </p><pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;ctime&gt;

#include &lt;iomanip&gt;          // for put_time
// #include &lt;string&gt;        // for the alternative code

using namespace std;

std::ostream &amp;now(std::ostream &amp;out)
{
    time_t seconds = time(0);

    return out &lt;&lt; put_time(localtime(&amp;seconds), "%c");

// Alternatively:
//
//    std::string timeText(asctime(localtime(&amp;seconds)));
//
//    timeText.pop_back();
//
//    return out &lt;&lt; timeText;
}

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; now &lt;&lt; '\n';
}
</pre>

<p>
Alternatively, the function <code>std::put_time</code> function can be used
(cf. <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/manip/put_time">http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/manip/put_time</a>).

        <strong>Exercise 55.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to prevent file clobbering by multiple
programs accessing the same file.
<p>
Consider the situation where we have a program that processes some kind of
database. The program is accessible to multiple users, and so two users may
run the program at the same time.
</p><p>
User 1 opens the database and reads a record, intending to update it.
At that point user 2 opens the same database, also intending to update that
record. With luck only one of the updates will take effect, but more often the
record will completely be clobbered, invalidating it for future users.
</p><p>
In this exercise we design a class <code>Lock</code> which can be used to prevent these
kinds of problems. Using <code>Lock</code>, once user 1 starts the program the database
is <em>locked</em>, and user 2's program will wait until user 1's program releases
the lock. Thus clobbering is prevented.
</p><p>
The class <code>Lock</code> has two constructors: 
    </p><ul>
    <li> <code>Lock(std::string const &amp;path)</code>: this constructor writes a lock file
(named <code>`path'.lck</code>) and uses that file for lock-adminstration. This assumes
that the user may create a file in the same directory as <code>path</code>;
<p>
</p></li><li> <code>Lock(std::string const &amp;path, std::string lockDir)</code>: this constructor
writes a lock file (named <code>`lockDir'/`basename path'.lck</code>) and uses that
file for lock-adminstration. This assumes that the user may create a file in
the directory `lockDir';
    </li></ul>
<p>
Hints: use <code>dirname</code> and <code>basename</code>: both functions have identical
prototypes: to use them, a single member (e.g. 
        `<code>stringName</code>'), 
    receiving either <code>dirname</code> or <code>basename</code> as its argument should
suffice to obtain either a path's `basename' or `dirname'. Make sure that this
member can be used without requiring an existing <code>Lock</code> object, so it can be
used in the first constructor to call the 2nd.
</p><p>
Once a <code>Lock</code> object has been constructed, <code>path</code> is locked and remains
locked until <code>Lock's</code> destructor releases the lock. This class
illustrates that destructors are not only used for deleting allocated memory,
but also to automatically perform administrative tasks, implied by the
functionality of their classes. 
</p><p>
Note that locking is not absolute: only programs using the locking convention
will benefit from the locking facilities. Another program, disregarding
locking, may still perform uncontrolled modifications of <code>path</code>. However, in
our example (users using locking-aware programs) this does not happen.
</p><p>
To lock a file the <code>.lck</code> file must be created if it doesn't yet exist. If
it already exists, then it can be reused. The function <strong>access</strong>(2) can be
used to check whether a file already does exist. If so, the file can be opened
in <em>read-write</em> mode, for which the predefined mode <code>O_RDWR</code> is used. If
not, the file is created empty, using the mode <code>O_CREAT | O_TRUNC | O_RDWR</code>
(cf. <strong>access</strong>(2)). Use a member 
        <code>lockPath</code> 
    to obtain the name of the lock file from a file's pathname and the
specification of the directory to contain the <code>.lck</code> file.
</p><p>
To lock a file the function <strong>flock</strong>(2) is used. Make sure that you use an
<em>exlusive lock</em>. The function <code>flock</code> accesses the file through a <em>file
descriptor</em>, rather than a file name. A file descriptor is an entry in an
operating system's table containing information about all open files. Use a
private member function <code>open</code> to open the lock file, returning its file
descriptor. To obtain a file's file descriptor use <strong>open</strong>(2), and provide it
with permission mode argument 0600 (note: this is an octal number, don't use
600!)
</p><p>
Unlocking is easy: if a file was locked, it's also open. In that case, merely
closing the file (cf. <strong>close</strong>(2)) is enough to release the lock. Make sure
you don't call <code>close</code> if the <code>Lock</code> object couldn't lock the file.
</p><p>
At several points locking may fail: an error in a file name, permissions may
not be sufficient, etc, etc. The class therefore also has a member <code>valid</code>
returning <code>true</code> if locking was successful, and <code>false</code> otherwise.
</p><p>
Hints: The class <code>Lock</code> is a small class. It only needs the mentioned
constructors, destructor, <code>open</code> and <code>valid</code> member functions, and the
abovementioned support members. It's also small wrt memory footprint: it only
needs to remember the lock file's file descriptor, which is an <code>int</code>.
</p><p>
Design and implement the class <code>Lock</code>. In addition, write a program that
locks access to a file (specified as the program's first command-line
argument): the program reads a line from its standard input, and appends it to
the file specified at the program's argument. Start the program in two
terminals, and make sure that the prompt <code>"? "</code> is only shown once the
program has obtained the lock. After the prompt is shown, read the input line
and append it to the file. Running three programs should also be possible.

        <strong>Exercise 56.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to use binary files. 
<p>
We had a server running a daemon, and the daemon didn't seem to start enough
processes. Did it actually start them but did the kernel kill them
immediately?  Or did it just not fork them in the first place? We didn't know.
</p><p>
Luckily, in Linux, process accounting can be enabled, like this:
 </p><pre>
    sudo accton path/to/pacctfile

</pre>

<p>
With process accounting thus turned on, on exit of each process the kernel
writes data about that process to the indicated file in the form of a
<code>struct acct_v3</code>, which can be found in <code>/usr/include/linux/acct.h</code>, but
only <em>if</em> that file is present. We give it here:
    </p><pre>
struct acct_v3
{
        char            ac_flag;                /* Flags */
        char            ac_version;             /* Always set to ACCT_VERSION */
        __u16           ac_tty;                 /* Control Terminal */
        __u32           ac_exitcode;            /* Exitcode */
        __u32           ac_uid;                 /* Real User ID */
        __u32           ac_gid;                 /* Real Group ID */
        __u32           ac_pid;                 /* Process ID */
        __u32           ac_ppid;                /* Parent Process ID */
        __u32           ac_btime;               /* Process Creation Time */
        float           ac_etime;               /* Elapsed Time */
        comp_t          ac_utime;               /* User Time */
        comp_t          ac_stime;               /* System Time */
        comp_t          ac_mem;                 /* Average Memory Usage */
        comp_t          ac_io;                  /* Chars Transferred */
        comp_t          ac_rw;                  /* Blocks Read or Written */
        comp_t          ac_minflt;              /* Minor Pagefaults */
        comp_t          ac_majflt;              /* Major Pagefaults */
        comp_t          ac_swaps;               /* Number of Swaps */
        char            ac_comm[ACCT_COMM];     /* Command Name */
};
    
</pre>

<p>
The kernel developers, not being the types to waste space or time, decided to
write the accounting data in binary form.  If a process is killed by the
kernel, its exit code has the numeric value of the <em>signal</em> that was used to
kill it.  The numbers of those signals are found in <code>signum.h</code>, which can be
included using <code>#include &lt;csignal&gt;</code>, and is given here for convenience:

Assignment:
    </p><ul>
    <li> Write a program that by default reads <code>/var/log/account/pacct</code>, or
        reads (an)other <strong>s</strong> if specified as command-line arguments.
<p>
For those of you who don't have their own process accounting to turn
        on, a file 'pacct' is available <a href="https://www.icce.rug.nl/edu/1/basicio/pacct.bin">here</a>. <em>Be
        careful:</em> this is a binary file, make sure you don't download it as a
        text-file. Its sha256 hash value must be

</pre>

<p>
</p></li><li> The program should output the names of all processes that didn't exit
        properly (proper exit is indicated by an exit code of 0).
<p>
</p></li><li> It is OK to output one process name multiple times if it was run
        multiple times.
<p>
</p></li><li> If the program is started with a '-a' option, it should output
        information about *all* exited processes, incuding those that properly
        exited.
<p>
</p></li><li> If the process was killed with <code>SIGKILL</code> or <code>SIGTERM</code>, mention
        the name of the signal, instead of the number.
    </li></ul>
<p>
Here is an example of the program's output:
</p><p>
</p><pre>
    $ ./ec ./pacct
    'gzip' 512
    'gzip' 512
    'dpkg-split' 256
    'dpkg-split' 256
    'update-alternat' 512
    'update-alternat' TERM
        
</pre>

<p>
Optional question:
</p><p>
It would be nice to be able to request the program to `tail' the
        accounting file. In that case it doesn't exit on end-of-file, but it
        resumes reading as soon as new data becomes available. In C, you would
        use facilities like <code>select, epoll</code> or <code>inotify</code>. Explain why it
        is hard to obtain the same effect in standard <strong>C++</strong>.
</p><p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    Our implementation uses the <code>Arg</code> singleton (and friends) to handle the
    command-line options (see the answers to the next exercises of this set). 
</p><p>
To create the program first build a library from the classes <code>arg,
    argoption, arglongoption</code> and <code>optstructarray</code>. This library (e.g.
    <code>libarg.a</code>) can also be used by future programs to handle command-line
    options. Then compile all of the program's sources (the sources in the
    project's directory and the directories <code>options</code> and <code>accounting</code> and
    link these to the <code>libarg.a</code> library). 
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.icce.rug.nl/edu/1/basicio/answers/pacct.tgz">basicio/answers/pacct.tgz</a>
</p><p>
Why is it hard to `tail' the accounting file?
</p><p>
C functions offer a way to put the program to sleep until new data appears
    at the input. This functionality is not available for streams. If we want
    to tail the file using only streams, we have to busy-loop.
</p><p>

        <strong>Exercise 57.</strong>
        <br>
        (optional)<br>Purpose of the exercise: experience some practical problems in using binary
I/O.
<p>
You earn two points if your program was well written and works OK
</p><p>
Our genes are held in molecules of DNA. DNA is described at a high level in
terms of base pairs, formed by nucleobases, of which the primary ones are
Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C). Let's assume for a
moment that there are only these four. (Uracil occurs in RNA, not DNA, and
we simply disregard any other nucleobases.)
</p><p>
The human genome contains quite a few nucleobases, about three billion
(short scale, 3E9). A human readable file with nucleobases represented by
ascii chars (ACTGATTGA etc.) would take roughly 3GB. Zipping aside, we could
reduce that a bit by writing binary files. A set of four possible characters
means two bits per character, resulting in size reduction by a factor four.
</p><p>
Assignment:
</p><p>
Write a program that converts between either of two formats:
    </p><ul>
    <li> Human-readable nucleobase letters A, C, T and G, and nothing
        else (except for maybe an optional final newline at the end of a
        file).
    </li><li> A binary (b) format of your own choice, with two bits per nucleobase
        (and perhaps a little overhead). 
    </li></ul>
<p>
Take the following into account:
    </p><ul>
    <li>  The file must take an in- and and output file name as arguments.
    </li><li> If an option '-b' is present, it must write binary output, if not, it
        must write human-readable.
    </li><li> If the human readable file contains anything but A, C, T, and G,
        return with nonzero status (either immediately or after operation).
    </li><li> Since we use all possible bit patterns for nucleobases when in binary
        mode, a human readable file could also be interpreted as binary. This
        must not happen, and we cannot let the user be responsible for
        preventing it. So the program must be able to conclude from the input
        whether it is binary or human-readable.
    </li><li> Let's say that an 'A' is represented in the binary format by two zero
        bits. Then what is the difference between the sequences ACAA and ACA
        when written in binary?
<p>
The program must also work around that. (Telomere extension is not
        allowed.)
    </p></li><li> A format that needs no seeking when it it written is better than one
        that does need seeking.
    </li></ul>

At two bits per nucleobase and four nucleobases per byte, any bit pattern is
in use, and so potentially any file would be valid input in binary mode.
</p><p>
This can be fixed using the common way (in UNIX) to distinguish a file format
from the next: by writing some fixed length 'magic' at the beginning of the
file.  If the file starts with this magic, it's recognized as being of the
specified format.
</p><p>
The magic can be as complex as you want, but considering the context you can
also apply the KISS principle: since the readable files only contain 'A', 'C',
'G' and 'T' characters, any other character can be used as magic. In our
implementation a <code>\b</code> (backspace) character is used. So, if the input file
starts with a backspace character it is the binary file.
</p><p>
A human readable file may also use magic. But the restriction that only 'A',
'C', 'G' and 'T' be present may itself serve as magic, as it clearly separates
the text file from the binary file.
</p><p>
The binary format must be capable of containing a number of nucleobases that
is not a multiple of four. In our implementation we use <em>padding</em>: following
the last byte containing the encoded nucleobase characters the final byte
contains the number of encoded nucleobase characters in the last but one
byte. 
</p><p>
As an example: if your textual input file contains AC, and A is encoded as 0,
C as 1, G as 2, and T as 3, then the binary file contains 3 bytes, having
hexadecimal values 0a, 04, 02.
</p><p>
In our implementation the class <code>DNA</code> handles the conversions. It uses a
pointer-to-member <code>d_get</code> which is either pointing at the function <code>int
getText()</code>, returning the next byte of encoded characters, or pointing at the
function <code>int getBinary()</code>, returning a nucleobase character (i.e., A, C, T,
or G). When <code>(this-&gt;d_get)()</code> returns EOF the end of input has been reached. 
</p><p>
`Converting' from text to text or binary to binary is simple: no special
actions are required, and the istream's buffer can simply be inserted into the
ostream. 
</p><p>
To convert from text to binary blocks of at most 4 characters are read, which
are then converted to binary coded values, stored in a single byte of the
returned <code>int</code>. The number of characters read is stored in <code>d_idx</code>. Having
returned the last data byte (which may involve fewer than 4 characters) EOF is
returned; the number of characters read last is then still available in
<code>d_idx</code>. 
</p><p>
To convert from binary to text the following algorithm is used:
</p><p>
Binary files are formatted like this:
    </p><pre>
    MAGIC                                   (1)
    4 bit-patterns per byte                 (2)
    1..4 bit pattern in last but 1 byte     (3)
    # bit patterns in previous byte         (4)
    
</pre>

<p>
(2) may be absent. The format implies that there are at least 2 bytes beyond
(1).
</p><p>
The data used for reading binary patterns uses these members:
    </p><pre>
    int d_idx       - the idx of the next coded ACTG value (initially 4)
                        (int is used because of a comparison with
                         d_byte[0]) 
    char d_byte[3]; - the next max. 3 bytes to process
    
</pre>

<p>
Two support functions are used:
    </p><pre>
    int codedChar() returns the coded character for the binary coded value
                    at d_byte[0]'s d_idx position, incrementing d_idx.

    int getBinaryEnd() returns EOF if d_idx == d_byte[1], 
                               otherwise codedChar()
    
</pre>

<p>
Initially (1) is skipped, and 2 bytes are read into <code>d_byte + 1</code>.  This must
succeed (if not: the input file is corrupted).
</p><p>
Next, in a while loop <code>getBinary</code> is called (through <code>d_get</code>) until
returning EOF 
</p><p>
<code>getBinary</code> performs the following actions:
        </p><pre>
    If d_idx == 4, 
            d_idx is reset to 0 (= the next coded value to return),
            d_byte[0..1] = d_byte[1..2], and 
            byte[2] is read. 
        If reading fails, get is reassigned to getBinaryEnd.
        (this-&gt;*d_get)() is returned
    else, codedChar() is returned.
        
</pre>

<p>
Explanation: if idx == 4 and reading succeeds, the recursive call results in
<code>codedChar</code> being called, until 4 character have been converted. If reading
fails, d_byte[1] holds the final byte and <code>getBinaryEnd</code> returns the
remaining available characters.

        <strong>Exercise 58.</strong>
        <br>
        (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: learn to display floating point numbers using
modifiers.
<p>
Construct a small program that defines <code>double value = 12.04</code> and then,
using <em>one</em> <code>cout</code> statement, display <code>value</code>, inserting its value into
<code>cout</code> as follows, using
    </p><ul>
    <li> fields of 15 characters wide, 
    </li><li> displaying <code>value</code> as follows, each on a new line:
        <ul>
        <li> without any special formatting (so just insert <code>value</code> in a
            field of 15 characters wide)
        </li><li> left aligned
        </li><li> right aligned
        </li><li> only the initial 3 digits of <code>value</code> (and the decimal dot, of
            course) 
        </li><li> using 4 numbers behind the decimal point 
        </li><li> the original <code>value</code> once again, as in the first line, without
            any special formatting
        </li></ul>
        In your program, the code realizing each of the above formats must
        also be provided on separate lines (this not only nicely organizes
        your statement, but also greatly helps us rating your exercise).

        <strong>Exercise 59.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose: Introducing to the <code>Arg</code> singleton, wrapping the <code>getopt()</code>
function. This exercise focuses on the construction of the <code>Arg</code> singleton
header file.
<p>
Note: this and the next exercise result in a very useful class. It's worth the
effort to give it a serious try.
</p><p>
One of the <em>functions</em> exercises was about using <strong>getopt</strong>(3) and
<strong>getopt_long</strong>(3). In this exercise we'll use the results from that exercise
to encapsulate option handling in a class <code>Arg</code>.
</p><p>
<strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>
</p><p>
Programs frequently use command-line arguments. Let's review that topic.
</p><p>
Program-options allow the programmer to tell the program what specific actions
it should take. Options are used to select specific modes of operation.
</p><p>
A nice example of a program allowing the user to specify options is the
program <strong>sort</strong>(1), see its manpage.
</p><p>
Some additional information about <code>getopt</code> and <code>getopt_long</code>:
These functions use several global variables:
    </p><ul>
    <li> <code>opterr</code> indicates how <code>getopt</code> handles problem-cases, and should be
set to 0. 
    </li><li> <code>char *optarg</code> points to the argument provided with options that
require arguments.
<p>
So, if our program is called as
        </p><pre>
    options -a -b 12 -d yes file1 file2
        
</pre>

    then <code>getopt</code> at one point returns <code>'b'</code>, with <code>optarg</code> pointing to
the text <code>"12"</code>. Once <code>getopt</code> returns -1, <code>optind</code> equals 3, and
<code>argv</code> has been reordered so that its final elements contain, respectively,
<code>file1</code> and <code>file2</code>.
    </li></ul>
<p>
<strong>FACILITIES</strong>
</p><p>
The class <code>Arg</code> must  offer the following facilities:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
    <li> <code>Arg &amp;initialize(char const *optstring, int argc, char **argv)</code><br>
       Initializes the <strong>Arg</strong> singleton. Must be called only once.  For now:
        calls <code>exit(1)</code> if called repeatedly. Returns a reference to the
        singleton object, allowing code initializing <strong>Arg</strong> to use the
        initialized object immediately.
<p>
Inside <code>Arg</code> make sure that the <code>optstring</code> used by <code>Arg</code> starts
        with a colon (<code>:</code>). This allows you to distinguish between unknown
        options and missing option arguments (cf: <strong>getopt</strong>(3)'s man-page's
        description of <code>getopt's</code> return value).
</p><p>
</p></li><li> <code>Arg &amp;initialize(char const *optstring,
                        LongOption const * const begin,
                        LongOption const * const end,
                        int argc, char **argv)</code><br>
       Initializes the <strong>Arg</strong> singleton. Accepts two iterators of an array of
        <strong>Arg::LongOption</strong> objects, holding long-options. Must be called only
        once. For now: calls <code>exit(1)</code> if called repeatedly.  See the
        description of <strong>Arg::LongOption</strong> below.  Returns a reference to the
        singleton object, allowing code initializing <strong>Arg</strong> to use the
        initialized object immediately.
<p>
<code>optstring</code> is defined as in the first overloaded version of
        <code>initialize</code>. 
</p><p>
</p></li><li> <code>Arg &amp;instance()</code> <br>
       Returns the instance of the <strong>Arg</strong> object, available after calling one
        of the <code>Arg::initialize()</code> members.  For now: if called before
        initialization, it should call <code>exit(1)</code>.
<p>
</p></li><li> <code>char const *argument(unsigned idx) const</code><br>
       Returns argument <code>idx</code>, after having removed the options.  0 is
        returned if the argument is not available.  The program name
        (<code>argv[0]</code>) is NOT counted here: idx 0 refers to the first
        <em>argument</em>, e.g., the program's <code>argv[1]</code>.
<p>
</p></li><li> <code>std::string const &amp;basename() const</code><br>
       Returns the basename of the program (make sure you keep the member's
        prototype as shown).
<p>
</p></li><li> <code>nArgs()</code><br>
       Returns the number of non-option arguments (not counting the program
        name).
<p>
</p></li><li> <code>nOptions()</code><br>
       Returns the number of single-character options. If short options have
        long option synonyms and long options were specified, then these long
        option synonyms are counted as if they were specified as single
        character options. If single character options (or their long option
        synonyms) are multiply specified, then each specification is counted
        as one option (so <code>-v -v</code> counts as two options).
<p>
</p></li><li> <code>unsigned option(int opt)</code><br>
       Returns the number of times option <code>opt</code> was specified, 0 indicating
        that the option was not given.
<p>
</p></li><li> <code>size_t option(std::string const &amp;options) const</code><br>
       The number of times one of the options specified in the `option'
        argument (or their long option synonyms) were present is returned.
<p>
</p></li><li> <code>size_t option(string *value, int option) const</code><br>
       Returns the number of times the provided option (or its long option
        synonym) was present. If the return value is non-zero then the value
        of the first occurrence of this option is stored in <code>*value</code>, which
        is left untouched if `option' was not present. 0 may be specified for
        <strong>value</strong> if the option does not have a value or if the value should
        not be stored.
<p>
</p></li><li> <code>size_t option(string *value, char const *longOption) const</code><br>
       Returns the number of times the specified long option (not having a
        single-character synonym) was present. Its value is then stored in
        <code>*value</code>, which is left untouched if the long option was not
        present. 0 may be specified for <strong>value</strong> if the option does not have
        a value or if the value should not be stored.
<p>
</p></li><li> <code>size_t option(size_t idx, string *value, 
                                        char const * longOption) const</code><br>
       Returns the number of times the provided long option (not having a
        single-character synonym) was present. If the return value is non-zero
        then the value of the <code>idx</code>th occurrence (0-based offset) of this
        long option is stored in <code>*value</code>, which is left untouched if the
        long option was not present or if <code>idx</code> is or exceeds the number of
        specifications of the provided long option. 0 may be specified for
        <strong>value</strong> if the long option does not have a value or if the value
        should not be stored.
<p>
</p></li><li> <code>bool versionHelp(void (*usage)(std::string const &amp;progname), 
        char const *version, size_t minArgs, int helpFlag = 'h', 
        int versionFlag = 'v') const</code><br>
       If <code>versionFlag</code> was specified, and the <code>helpFlag</code> was not
        specified the program's name (using <code>basename()</code>) and <code>version</code> is
        displayed to <code>std::cout</code>. Otherwise, if the <code>helpFlag</code> was
        provided or if there are fewer arguments than <code>minArgs</code> <code>usage()</code>
        is called with argument <strong>basename()</strong>. If either  version-
        or help information is shown <code>true</code> is returned (and your program
        should end, returning 0 to the operating system).
        <br>
       Note that <code>versionhelp</code> compares <code>minArgs</code> against <code>nArgs</code>. If
        <code>minArgs</code> should be compaired against the number of arguments up to
        a possible `--' argument (i.e., <code>beyondDashes</code>' return value), then
        add <code>nArgs() - beyondDashes()</code> to the <code>minArg</code> argument. E.g.,
            <pre>
    arg.versionHelp(usage, version, 2 + arg.nArgs() - arg.beyondDashes());
            
</pre>

       The address of the <code>usage</code> function, the current version and the
        minimum number of arguments must be specified. Default argument values
        are provided for the option flags.
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>
In addition it defines an <code>enum Type</code> having the values <code>None, Required,</code>
and <code>Optional</code>. These enum values can be used when specifying
<code>longOptions</code>:
</p><p>
<strong>THE NESTED CLASS Arg::LongOption</strong>
</p><p>
Long options are defined using objects of the nested class
<strong>Arg::LongOption</strong>. This class is defined inside the class <code>Arg</code> and 
has these constructors:
    </p><ul>
    <li> <code>Arg::LongOption(char const *name, Arg::Type type = Arg::None)</code><br>
       This constructor is used to define a long option for which no
        corresponding short option is defined. The parameter <code>name</code> is the
        name of the long option (without prefixing the <code>--</code> characters,
        which <em>are</em> required when specifying the long option).
    </li><li> <code>Arg::LongOption(char const *name, int optionChar)</code><br>
       This constructor is used to define a long option for which a
        corresponding short option is defined. The parameter <code>name</code> is the
        name of the long option (without prefixing the <code>--</code> characters,
        which <em>are</em> required when specifying the long option).
    </li></ul>
    In a program, long options may be specified as follows:
    <ul>
    <li> First, construct an array 
        <pre>
    Arg::LongOption longOptions[] = { c1, c2, ... cn }
        
</pre>

    Where <code>c1, c2, ..., cn</code> are <strong>n</strong> constructions of anonymous
            <strong>Arg::LongOption()</strong> objects.
    </li><li> Next, pass <strong>longOptions, LongOptions + n</strong>
                as 2nd and 3rd arguments to <code>Arg::initialize</code>
    </li></ul>
<p>
<strong>EXAMPLE:</strong>
</p><p>
Here is an example showing how <code>Arg</code> can be used: options are specified in
<code>main's</code> <em>anonymous</em> namespace, so <code>longOptions</code> do not pollute the
global namespace:
</p><p>
</p><pre>
    Arg::LongOption longOptions[] = 
    {
        Arg::LongOption{"debug"},
        Arg::LongOption{"filenames", 'f'},
        Arg::LongOption{"help", 'h'},
        Arg::LongOption{"version", 'v'},
    };
    auto longEnd = longOptions + sizeof(longOptions) / sizeof(longOptions[0]);
    // or, since C++17:
    //   longEnd = longOptions + std::size(longOptions)


    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    try
    {
        Arg &amp;arg = Arg::initialize("df:hv", 
                        longOptions, longEnd, argc, argv);
    
        // code using arg, etc.
    }
        
</pre>
    
<p>
<strong>ASSIGNMENT:</strong>
</p><p>
Submit the complete header file of the (singleton) class <code>Arg</code>. Your
class interface should not just show the abovementioned members, but should
also clearly show how you're realizing the integrity of the class's data. So,
after calling an <code>intialize</code> member modification of <code>argv's</code> values may
not affect the information maintained by the <code>Arg</code> object.
</p><p>
The <code>Arg</code> class may reorder the elements of <code>argv</code> (because that's
what <code>getopt</code> is doing), but then it must store its own copies of any 
remaining (i.e., after the options have been removed) arguments, as well as
its own copy of the program-name.
</p><p>
Hint:
    Store the options in a <code>string d_option</code>, and store any values that
may be associated with them in a <code>string **d_arg</code> array. This way, when
looking for a particular option, you can immediately use its index in the
option string to obtain any value that may be associated with it from
<code>d_arg</code>.

        <strong>Exercise 60.</strong>
        <br>
        (optional)<br>Purpose: Complete the class <code>Arg</code> by implementing its members.
<p>
When correctly completed this exercise earns you 3 points: 1 point for
correctly implementing its data organization, 2 points for the member
implementations (some members can very well be implemented inline. Your
implementation probably also benefits from some additional support member
functions).
</p><p>
Put some energy in avoiding making the class <code>Arg</code> too complex.
</p><p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    The archive containing the class's implementation and a small demo program
can be downloaded <a href="https://www.icce.rug.nl/edu/1/pointers2/answers/arg.tgz">here</a>.
</p><p>
The class <code>Arg</code> quickly becomes too complex if it embeds all its
tasks. The current implementation uses two support classes (<code>ArgOption</code> and
<code>ArgLongOption</code>) and a nested class <code>LongOption</code> to handle fairly
independent tasks. <code>ArgOption</code> handles single-letter options,
<code>ArgLongOption</code> handles long options. 
</p><p>
The <code>main</code> function is a mere demo program. It defines a demo <code>usage</code>
function merely to illustrate <code>Arg's versionhelp</code> member. Thus it violates
the one-function-one-file design.
