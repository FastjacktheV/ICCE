\section{Exercise 46}
\begin{question}
    Write a speed test.
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
In 46 there is a main program provided.
Sadly it uses a pointer as argument to the add member function.
This will not work. Add expects a string as argument, not a pointer.

So we have altered the stresstest to the following code:

    \subsection{main.cc}
    \cppfile{../46/45/main.cc}

Given the short time remaining there was no way to come up with a better solution.

Here are the results we got:

Original class as provided:
Output: none
Takes quite some time to process, about 20 sec.

Strings class according to exercise 44:
output: none
pretty fast. Done in less than a sec.

Strings class according to exercise 45:
Output: file: 
    \subsection{ouput.txt}
    \textfile{../46/45/output.txt}
No oportunity to speed test.

Best result we had with 44. This implementation worked and was a lot faster than
the original. 
Not sure what happened with 45 though. Maybe by doubling the amount of memory 
the program wants to claim more than is available at that time. We could see it doubles
a few times the memory before giving the error as stated.

\end{solution}
