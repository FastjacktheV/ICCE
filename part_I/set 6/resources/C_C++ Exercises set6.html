<h1>Chapter 6: Exercises set six: Pointers Part 2. Deadline: October 26</h1>
            <br><br>
<p>
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 42.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: Familiarize yourself with the various new/delete
variants.
<p>
What are the variants of new/delete? For each of the variants provide a
(short!) example in which the used new/delete is appropriate and provide a
short explanation why it is appropriately used.
</p><p>
<br><br>
    
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 43.</strong>
        <br>
        
<p>
Purpose: learn to implement destructors for classes requiring them.
</p><p>
Earlier, the class <code>Strings</code> was introduced. Since the class allocates its
own memory its objects cause memory leaks once they go out of scope.
</p><p>
Prevent the  memory leak: objects going out of scope should always
automatically delete all the memory they've allocated for themselves.
</p><p>
Note: this modification of the <code>Strings</code> class doesn't make it full-proof,
yet. We'll handle that shortly.
</p><p>
Only submit the modified header file and the member(s) you added to
<code>Strings</code> to ensure that a <code>Strings</code> object does not cause a memory leak
when it goes out of scope.
</p><p>
<br><br>
    
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 44.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose: learn to use double pointers.
<p>
The class <code>Strings</code> clearly uses a highly inefficent algorithm for adding
another string, as it has to copy its full data structure for every newly
added string.
</p><p>
Can we do better? Yes. First of all, a double pointer only needs to extend the
array of pointers. Existing strings, once allocated, can be reused. Second,
the array of pointers doesn't have to be copied at every new string. The
class could use a doubling rule: each time the array is full,
allocate enough room to store twice the number of strings. 
</p><p>
When doubling, the additional pointers don't have to be initialized. We can
postpone initialization until it's actually required. It's probably a good
idea to make the initial capacity equal to 1, allowing you to implement a
simple doubling algorithm. Alternatively, you could extend in fixed block
sizes (e.g., allowing the object to store 100 additional strings).
</p><p>
Modify the existing class <code>Strings</code> so that a double pointer is used. The
class now needs a third data member: <code>d_capacity</code>, informing the object
about the number of pointers that are in fact in use.
</p><p>
Make sure the destructor and <code>destroy</code> functions are modified accordingly.
</p><p>
The class should also be provided with <code>capacity</code>, <code>reserve</code> and
<code>resize</code> facilities. These serve two distinct purposes. Take a look at the
<code>std::string</code> class for an example, and copy the behaviour it exhibits.
</p><p>
When resizing to a larger amount of <code>std::string</code> objects
the new <code>std::string</code> elements should be initialized using the default
constructor. When resizing to a smaller amount, delete the strings
affected by the resizing operation. When reserving to a smaller amount, do
nothing, except maybe deleting the strings affected by the
reserve-operation. The <code>d_capacity</code> member itself should not be affected.
</p><p>
In this exercise you may assume that enlarging the capacity is always
possible, so no checks for legal capacity values are required.
</p><p>
Hint: define a support function <code>rawPointers</code> that is provided with the
number of pointers to strings to allocate and that returns a pointer to that
number of pointers to strings.
</p><p>
Submit the modified class <code>Strings</code>, using double pointers. 
</p><p>
Note that the <code>main</code> function used for the demo of the original
<code>Strings</code> class can be reused without any modifications at all.
</p><p>
<br><br>
    
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 45.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose: learn to use the placement new operator.
<p>
The class <code>Strings</code> using a double pointer clearly offers an improvement
over the basic form, allocating an array.
</p><p>
What about a third way to handle allocation? The <em>placement new</em> operator
allows us to allocate blocks of (raw) memory, installing our data in it on
request.
</p><p>
The class can still use a doubling rule: each time the array is full, 
enough room is allocated to store twice the number of strings. This time, raw
memory to allocate the strings in, not pointers to strings.
</p><p>
When doubling, the room for extra strings doesn't have to be initialized. We
can postpone initialization until it's actually required. Again set the
initial capacity equal to 1, allowing you to implement a simple doubling
algorithm.
</p><p>
Modify the class <code>Strings</code> so that the placement new operator is used. All
the previous class <code>Strings</code>' facilities (including those of the class using
double pointers, so <code>capacity, reserve</code> and <code>resize</code> should still be
available.
</p><p>
Make sure the destructor and <code>destroy</code> functions are modified accordingly.
</p><p>
Hint: define a support function <code>rawStrings</code> that is provided with the
number of raw strings to allocate and that returns a pointer to that storage
area.
</p><p>
<br><br>
    
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 46.</strong>
        <br>
        (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: learn to select an efficient implementation
<p>
In the previous exercises the <code>Strings</code> class was implemented using double
pointers and an implementation using placement new was developed. Together
with the original implementation of the <code>Strings</code> class we now have three
different implementations.  
</p><p>
Here is a <code>main</code> function that can be used to perform a `stress test' of 
a <code>Strings</code> object:
</p><p>
</p><pre>
    extern char **environ;
    
    int main()
    {
        for (size_t iter = 0; iter != 1000; ++iter)
        {
            Strings env(environ);
    
            for (size_t rept = 0; rept != 100; ++rept)
            {
                for (char **ptr = environ; *ptr; ++ptr)
                    env.add(*ptr);
            }
        }
    }
        
</pre>

<p>
Use this program in combination with each of the three <code>Strings</code>
implementations (so you create three programs). Then start each of the
programs as argument of the <strong>time</strong>(1) program (e.g., execute <code>time
stresstest</code>) and decide which implementation to prefer
based on the execution times. 
</p><p>
Submit the output of the <code>time</code> program for each of the three programs, and
submit your conclusion about which implementation to prefer.
</p><p>
<br><br>
    
</p><p>
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 47.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to convert a switch to using pointers to
functions. 
<p>
In exercise 29 we developed the CPU class, simulating a basic CPU. In the
implementation of that class several switches were used. Redesign the class in
such a way that the switches are each replaced by a single expression
statement (using pointers to functions). Submit the modified header and
modified functions.
</p><p>
<br><br>
    
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 48.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to design and implement a non-trivial class
<p>
In this exercise you learn to design and implement the class <code>CSV</code>, handling
comma separated values (CSVs). Although the full specification of CSVs is
found in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt">RFC 4180 (section 2)</a>, in
this exercise we'll implement only the basics of CSVs.
</p><p>
According to RFC 4180 lines contain comma separated values: comma separated
values on one line are processed together, as a series of values. The final
comma separated value on a line is not ended by a comma.
</p><p>
You may assume that the individual CSVs do not contain
commas, do not extend over multiple lines, and are not surrounded by double
quotes. Although this differs from the official specification, it's considered
acceptable in the current context. But comma separated values may be
empty: the following line defines three empty comma separated values:
        </p><pre>
,,
        
</pre>

    The first empty value starts at the beginning of the line, and continues
up to the first comma; the second empty value starts beyond the first comma
and continues up to the second comma; the third empty value starts beyond the
second comma, and continues up to the end of the line. If the line ends in
blank space characters then the third value isn't empty, but contains those
blank space characters.
<p>
Of course, there's always a situation where the separator isn't a comma, but
e.g., a semicolon. For that the constructor has a 2nd parameter <code>fieldSep</code>
which by default equals <code>','</code>. Its 1st parameter is <code>field</code>, by default 0,
specifying the number of CSVs on a line. If 0 then the number of CSVs on the 
first line determines the number of fields.
</p><p>
The class supports the following members:
    </p><ul>
    <li> <code>void clear(size_t nFields = 0)</code>
       The internally stored data are erased. By default, the required number
        of CSV fields is reset to 0, but can be set to a specific value by
        specifying a value for its <code>nFields</code> parameter.
<p>
</p></li><li> <code>std::string const *const *const *data()</code>
       A pointer to the lines of CSVs is returned. Each line is stored as an
        array of pointers to the strings containing the actual CSVs. Each of
        these arrays holds the same number of pointers to strings (see the
        members <code>nFields</code> and <code>size</code> below). Note that a <em>triple</em>
        pointer is returned. To access an individual CSV use the requested
        line index, then the requested field index. Then dereference that
        pointer to obtain the CSV.
<p>
</p></li><li> <code>std::string const &amp;lastLine()</code>
       A reference to the last line that was successfully extracted from the
        input stream by the <code>read1</code> member is returned. So once the lines
        containing the comma separated values have been processed, the next
        line on the input stream is obtained from this member.
<p>
</p></li><li> <code>size_t nFields()</code>
       After successfully calling <code>read1</code> for the first time this member
        returns the required number of comma separated values that must be
        encountered on subsequent input lines.
<p>
</p></li><li> <code>size_t read(std::istream &amp;in, size_t nLines = 0)</code>
       By default, all lines of <code>in</code> are read and are processed by the
        <code>read1</code> member. By specifying a non-zero value for the <code>nLines</code>
        parameter the specified number of lines is read from <code>in</code>.  Reading
        stops once <code>in's</code> status is not <code>good</code>. When <code>nLines</code> is
        specified as zero, then reading continues until all CSV lines have
        been processed. The number of successfully processed lines is
        returned.
<p>
</p></li><li> <code>bool read1(std::istream &amp;in)</code>
       One line is read from <code>in</code> and is parsed for its CSVs. If parsing
        fails, <code>false</code> is returned. After successfully calling
        <code>read1</code> for the first time all subsequent lines read by <code>read1</code>
        must have the same number of comma separated values as encountered
        when calling <code>read1</code> for the first time..
<p>
</p></li><li> <code>std::string ***release()</code>
       A pointer to the lines of CSVs is returned. See the member <code>data</code> for
        details about the returned triple pointer. After calling <code>release</code> 
        the internally stored triple pointer has been reset to its initial
        value.  Note that this member does not reset the
        number of expected fields for subsequently processed CSV-lines. If
        that's what you want, call <code>clear</code> after calling <code>release</code>.
<p>
</p></li><li> <code>size_t size()</code>
       The number of CSV lines that's currently stored in the CSV object is
        returned. 
    </li></ul>
<p>
Note that in the overview of member functions <code>const</code> attributes have
not been used: it's up to you to determine which members should be
const. 
</p><p>
Hints: 
    </p><ul>
    <li> use an initial capacity of 1, and double the number of elements that
can be stored once the capacity is exhausted. Since in general you're going to
allocate memory to represent multiple lines of CSVs, realize that the initial
capacity's memory must also refer to an array, and not merely to a single
pointer.
<p>
</p></li><li> to transfer a block of memory the function <strong>memcpy</strong>(3) may be
used. Be sure to multiply the number of elements by their size.
<p>
</p></li><li> of course, once the first line of CSVs has been read or when
<code>nFields</code> has been specified, the number of fields is known, and the
required memory for subsequent lines of CSVs can thereupon immediately be
allocated. A similar consideration applies to the number of lines.
<p>
</p></li><li> at CSV's level of specification the CSVs themselves should not be
handled: handling the CSVs themselves is at another level of aggregation than
what's expected of the class CSV. Therefore, retrieving individual CSV values
is embedded in a separate class (<code>CSVextractor</code>), which is then used by the
class CSV (also see the next exercises).
    </li></ul>
<p>
Design and submit the class CSV's interface, and submit a drawing clearly
showing how the CSVs are reached using <code>data()'s</code> return value.
</p><p>
<br><br>
    
</p><p>
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 49.</strong>
        <br>
        (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: learn to implement a non-trivial class
<p>
(See the CSV exercise) Implement the members of the class CSV.
</p><p>
At this point, based on the description of the class CSV, you know that
handling the CSV fields is the responsibility of the class CSVextractor. When
implementing CSV, avoid thinking about how CSVextractor should be
implemented. Rather, when you need to process a line's CSV fields, assume a
matching member exists, and call that member in your CSV implementation.
</p><p>
<br><br>
    
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 50.</strong>
        <br>
        (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: learn to design a support class
<p>
(See the CSV exercise) Design and implement the class CSVextractor. 
</p><p>
This is a support class for CSV, and so its public members are used by
CSV. Those members should have names that are comparable to the names used by
CSV. Avoid big functions: always ask yourself what a function's purpose is,
and then implement that in such a way that the function's implementation
closely follows its semantic description.
</p><p>
Submit the class's interface and implementation.
</p><p>
<br><br>
    
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 51.</strong>
        <br>
        (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: learn to use a non-trivial class
<p>
Implement a <code>main</code> function in which <code>cin</code> is read, all CSV
values of all lines are shown, prefixed by their line and CSV indices, and
finally showing the first line that didn't contain the required number of
CSVs.
</p><p>
Your test-input should also contain some empty CSV fields.
</p><p>
When designing a class a small <em>driver</em> program can (should) be constructed
showing that all members of your class are correctly working. For this
exercise also design and submit a driver program for the class
<code>CSVextractor</code>.
