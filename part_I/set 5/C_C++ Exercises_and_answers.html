<h1>Chapter 5: Exercises set five: Pointers Part 1. Deadline: October 19</h1>
            <br><br>
<p>
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 34.</strong>
        <br>
            Purpose: acquire some familiarization with the pointer concept.
<p>
Describe in your own words (use Dutch if you're Dutch). Be concise: just
    mention the, in your opinion, essential difference(s).
</p><p>
</p><ol>
    <li> what differences exist between pointer variables and arrays;
    </li><li> what differences exist between pointer variables and reference
         variables;
    </li><li> how element <code>[3][2]</code> is reached (maybe make a drawing?)
            <pre>
        a: for the variable `tt(int array[20][30])'
        b: for the variable `tt(int *pointer[20])'.
            
</pre>

        Your drawing should clearly show how the memory accessed by 
        <code>array</code> and <code>pointer</code> is (differently) organized;
    </li><li> what is meant by `pointer arithmetic';
    </li><li> explain why accessing an element in an array using only a pointer
        variable is to be preferred over using an index expression. By
        implication: why are repetitions iterating over a series of elements
        using a pointer-type loop control variable preferred over repetitions
        in which the loop control variable is, e.g., a <code>size_t</code> type
        variable?
    </li></ol>
<p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    </p><ol>
    <li> Differences between pointer variables and arrays:
        <ul>
        <li> Pointer: variable, array: address (a mere value)
        </li><li> Pointer: lvalue    array: rvalue
        </li></ul>
    </li><li> Differences between pointer variables and references:
        <ul>
        <li> Pointer: variable, may be reassigned; Reference: fixed
                association to the variable/object it refers to.
        </li><li> Asignment to the pointer: changes the location to where the
            pointer points, assignment to the reference: changes the
            variable/object it refers to.
        </li></ul>
    </li><li> How element <code>[3][2]</code> is reached
            <pre>
        a: for the variable `int array[20][30]'
                from the address `array', find the offset of its fourth row (3
                * 30 ints farther), then add the offset of an int 2 ints
                farther. 

        b: for the variable `int *pointer[20]'
                take the value of its 4th element (offset 3), add to that
                value the offset of an int 2 ints farther.
            
</pre>

        Also, make clear in a drawing or diagram how the memory accessed by 
        <code>array</code> and <code>pointer</code> is organized.
            <pre>
    array:
        int[0][0], int[0][1] .. int [0][29], int[1][0], ... int[19][29]

    pointer:
       0 [int * ]--&gt; [ 30 consecutive ints, somewhere in memory ]
       1 [int * ]--&gt;
         ...
      19 [int * ]--&gt; [ 30 consecutive ints, somewhere in memory unrelated to
                          the locations of the other vectors of 30 ints]
                
</pre>

<p>
</p></li><li> What is meant by `pointer arithmetic'<br> Adding a number (positive,
        negative) to a pointer reaches the element than number of data
        elements to which the pointer points farther.<br> Subtracting two
        pointers (to identical data types) returns the number of data elements
        between the two pointers, counting from the second to (not including)
        the first pointer.
    </li></ol>

<br><br>
    
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 35.</strong>
        <br>
            Purpose: learn to use equivalent pointer-expressions for
array-expressions. 
<p>
Complete the table below, by entering the empty fields of the `pointers'
    and `semantics' columns. 
</p><p>
As shown in the first line, the index-expressions should be rewritten
    without using the index-operator <code>[]</code>. In all cases you have to use
    pointer notations. 
</p><p>
The `semantics' column should (concisely!) describe what the rewritten
    statement does.
</p><p>
Assume that all elements have properly been initialized. When writing the
    pointer expressions you may assume that the variables are properly defined
    and initialized pointer variables.
</p><p>
Submit the completed table. The first line (<code>int x[8]</code>) is an example
    line, and may be omitted.
</p><p>
Hints: simplify your expressions as much as possible. Avoid SF
    parentheses. Some expressions to rewrite are not accepted by the
    compiler, but even then the expressions can be rewritten using pointer
    notations.

                                                             and receives the value of

                                                             are added. That pointer is dereferenced
                                                             resulting in a char *, which is inserted
                                                             into cout.

 int x[];         &amp;x[10] - &amp;x[3];    7                       Two addresses are subtracted. Pointer
                                                             arithmetic yields the # elements from
                                                             element 3 to 10.

 char *argv[];    argv[0]++;         (*argv)++               argv is dereferenced yielding the 1st 
                                                             char pointer. That pointer is used,
                                                             but its incremented as a side effect

                                                             so that it now points to the location
                                                             one char * farther than to where argv
                                                             originally pointed.

 char *argv[];    ++argv[0];         ++*argv                 argv is dereferenced, yielding a char *
                                                             variable. That pointer value is

                                                             yielding the location of the 3rd 
                                                             character of *argv's string. That 
                                                             location is dereferenced, yielding
                                                             a character variable, which is 
                                                             incremented. E.g., if *argv points to
                                                             "hello world", then following the 
                                                             expression it contains "hemlo world"

        <strong>Exercise 36.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to define an array of undetermined size
<p>
In the scripting language Perl it's rather usual to completely read all
information before starting processing the information. 
</p><p>
Can we do that, too? Yes we can, albeit that it is a practice that's frowned
upon if it isn't really necessary. For a not-too-big input file it's doable. 
</p><p>
Define a class <code>Strings</code> that can either be initialized with an <code>argc,
argv</code> pair of arguments, with an <code>environ</code> type of argument, or with an
input stream. As yet, we haven't covered streams, but you may define a 
    </p><pre>
    Strings(std::istream &amp;in)
    
</pre>

    constructor, which may be passed <code>std::cin</code> as argument. This
constructor will then process all lines in the provided <code>istream</code>. If your
code does not use <code>cin</code> (or <code>cout</code>), but merely uses the facilities
offered by <code>cin</code> (like <code>getline</code> or the extractor operator) then you don't
have to include <code>iostream</code>, but you should include <code>istream</code>.
<p>
The <code>argv</code> parameter is an array of pointers to <strong>C</strong>-strings, and so is
<code>environ</code>. 
</p><p>
The class itself defines a data member <code>d_size</code> holding the number of
strings that are stored in the object, and a data member (<code>d_str</code>), a single
(rather than double) pointer, that is used to store the <code>char *</code> values (or
the lines read from an <code>istream</code>.
</p><p>
Caveat: each element or line must be stored in a separate <code>std::string</code>
object, so do not concatenate all received elements in one big string pointed
at by <code>d_str</code>.
</p><p>
For this exercise, construct the class header file and implement (and submit)
all (4) constructors. If you complete the full class (see the next exercise)
then submit the full class header with this exercise.
</p><p>
Hint: When a new string is added to the object and you don't know in advance
how many strings eventually will be stored, then add the strings one at a
time. Do this as follows in a member function <code>add</code>. There should be just
one member <code>add</code>, which must be able to add either a <code>std::string</code> or a
NTBS (called `the next string' in the following itemization) to the
<code>Strings</code> object. This member should perform the following tasks:
    </p><ul>
    <li> copy the currently stored strings to a new storage area
    </li><li> add the next string to the new storage area
    </li><li> destroy the information pointed at by <code>d_str</code>
    </li><li> update <code>d_str</code> and <code>d_size</code> so that they refer to the new storage
        area.
    </li></ul>

        <strong>Exercise 37.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to add/extend the user interface of a class,
and learn to use the class in a program.
<p>
Provide the class <code>Strings</code> (see previous exercise) with the following
members. Some members are merely accessors and if you feel it's safe they can
be implemented as inline members.
</p><p>
Add members
    </p><ul>
    <li> <code>size</code>, returning the number of strings that are stored in the
        object;
    </li><li> <code>data</code>, returning a pointer to the strings that are stored in the
        <code>Strings</code> object.
    </li><li> <code>at</code>, returning a reference to a non-modifiable string, given its
        index;
    </li><li> <code>at</code>, returning a reference to a modifiable string, given its index;
    </li><li> <code>release</code>, returning a struct having a field <code>string *</code>
        pointing to the same location as <code>d_str</code> (before calling
        <code>release</code>), and a field <code>size_t</code> containing the number of
        stored strings (before calling <code>release</code>). After calling <code>release</code>
        the <code>Strings</code> object is in the same state as after calling the
        default constructor (as a side-note: <code>release</code> passes the
        responsibility for handling the information, previously owned by the
        <code>Strings</code> object, to <code>release's</code> caller).
    </li></ul>
<p>
Hint: when <code>at</code> is called with an illegal (i.e., too big) index, then
        return an empty string (not the best solution, but a reasonable one,
        considering the topics covered so far).
</p><p>
Also, use a backdoor, so that you don't have to duplicate the bodies
        of the two <code>at</code> functions.
</p><p>
In what situation will the first <code>at</code> member be used and in what situation
the second?
</p><p>
Note: this class should never be used `for real' as it results in
memory leaks. We'll handle that problem in the near future.
</p><p>
In addition to the <code>Strings</code> implementation, submit a program
        implementing the empty-lines filter program (cf. ex. 14), using a
        <code>Strings</code> object. So what again did this filter do? It must read all
        lines from <code>cin</code> and then print all lines except for the leading and
        trailing blank lines. So define in <code>main</code> a <code>Filter</code> object, and
        call its <code>display</code> member.

        <strong>Exercise 38.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to manipulate complex objects without much
effort.
<p>
Define a function <code>stringsSwap</code> swapping the contents of two <code>Strings</code>
objects. After having called <code>stringsSwap</code> for two <code>Strings</code> objects
<code>objectA</code> and <code>objectB</code>, objectA) should have <code>objectB</code>'s contents and
vice versa.
</p><p>
Hint: this is a <em>very simple</em> exercise if you think a little bit `out of the
box': don't just concentrate too much on this exercise's literal text....
</p><p>
A cryptic hint: what you have isn't always everything you have.
</p><p>
Caveat: this exercise is about <code>Strings</code> objects, not <code>std::string</code>
objects. 
</p><p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    So why do you have to think `out of the box'? Here's why and how to
implement the swapping facility.
</p><p>
Think out of the box: don't just quickly define a blunt <code>Strings</code>
swapping function. Instead think a little while and you'll realize that you'll
have to implement the swapping facility as a member of <code>Strings</code>: you'll
have to extend the class's interface.
</p><p>
A member function can directly access <code>Strings</code>' data members resulting in a
remarkably simple implementation. Here is the example defining a
<code>Strings::swap</code> member:
        </p><pre>
    #include "strings.ih"
    
    void Strings::swap(Strings &amp;other)
    {
        string *tmp = d_str;
        d_str = other.d_str;
        other.d_str = tmp;
    
        size_t size = d_size;
        d_size = other.d_size;
        other.d_size = size;
    }
        
</pre>

<p>
The following solution (or any of its variants), however, is questionable:
        </p><pre>
    void stringsSwap(Strings &amp;first, Strings &amp;second)
    {
        Strings tmp(first);
        first = second;
        second = tmp;
    }
        
</pre>

    It is questionable because you're outside of the class <code>Strings</code> and
thus may not assume anything about its inner organization. E.g., <code>Strings</code>
objects could at some later release have a pointer pointing to themselves,
e.g., <code>Strings *d_self</code>. Now the above <code>stringsSwap</code> function doesn't swap
anymore; instead it breaks the integrity of the <code>Strings</code> objects. To see
why, consider two <code>Strings</code> objects. We have, before the swap:
    <pre>
    Strings first:
        d_self: points to first

    Strings second:
        d_self: points to second
    
</pre>

    Now we're swapping first and second, using the above function. So the
result becomes:
    <pre>
    Strings first:
        d_self: points to second

    Strings second:
        d_self: points to first
    
</pre>

        and the <code>stringsSwap</code> function breaks the semantics of <code>d_self</code>.
<p>
As a consequence, swapping functions should be member functions of
classes. In order to swap <code>Strings</code> objects a member <code>void
Strings::swap(Strings &amp;other)</code> must be defined: swapping is the
responsibility of the class designer who can (and should) correctly implement
swapping.
</p><p>

        <strong>Exercise 39.</strong>
        <br>
        (optional)<br>    Purpose: Construct and use a pointer to a multi (2) dimensional matrix.
<p>
In <code>main</code>, define the array <code>int square[10][10]</code> (Note that the
dimensions of the array (10 rows, 10 columns) are known. This knowledge may be
used when completing this exercise).
</p><p>
Next, define and initialize a pointer <code>row</code>, pointing to the rows of this
array. Note that <code>row[0]</code> should therefore point to the first of
<code>square</code>'s <em>rows</em> and <code>row[9]</code> should point to the last of <code>square</code>'s
<em>rows</em>, not its <code>int</code> elements. 
</p><p>
Pass this pointer to a function <code>inv_identity</code> initializing the <em>full</em>
array <code>square</code> to ones, except for the elements on the main diagonal (i.e.,
<code>square[0][0], square[1][1], square[2][2]</code>, etc., which should be set to 0).
</p><p>
Implement <code>main</code> and make sure that <code>inv_identity</code> only receives one
argument: the pointer <code>row</code>. Also implement the function <code>inv_identity</code>. 
</p><p>
With respect to <code>inv_identity</code>: this function should contain two nested
<code>for</code> loops. The (only) variables defined in the function are (1) its
parameter, (2) a pointer variable in the initialization section of the first
<code>for</code> statement and (3) two pointer variables in the initialization section
of the second (nested) <code>for</code> statement.
</p><p>
The nested <code>for</code> statement should itself contain one nested assignment
statement. So, <code>inv_identity</code> must be constructed according to the following
mold:
        </p><pre>
    void identity( 1 pointer-type parameter comes here )
    {
        for ( 1 pointer is defined here ; ... ; ...)
        {
            for ( 2 pointers are defined here ; ... ; ...)
                1 assignement statement comes here
        }
    }
        
</pre>

<p>
Submit the two functions <code>main</code> and <code>inv_identity</code> implementing the
program of this exercise.
    <br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    Note the parameter of the following <code>inv_identity</code> function: it can't be
just <code>int *ptr</code>, but it needs the row-dimension in its definition:
        </p><pre>
    void identity(int (*rows)[10])
    {
        for (int (*row)[10] = rows + 10; row-- != rows; )
        {
            for 
            (
                int *col = *row, *last = *row + 10; 
                    col != last;
                        ++col
            )
                *col =  !(row - rows == col - *row);
        }
    }

    int main()
    {
        int square[10][10];
        int (*row)[10] = square;

        cout &lt;&lt; "check: this must be 1: " &lt;&lt; (row[1] == square[1]) &lt;&lt; '\n';

        identity(row);      // or: identity(square)
    
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 10; ++j)
                cout &lt;&lt; square[i][j] &lt;&lt; " ";
            cout &lt;&lt; '\n';
        }
    }

        <strong>Exercise 40.</strong>
        <br>
        (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: learn to use pimpl.
<p>
There is a quite bit of background theory in this exercise. Study it before
working on this exercise.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>
Consider a class <code>Person</code> containing data of a person. Initially the design
of the class concentrated on storing name, address, and telephone
number. Keeping things simple, the class could start like this:
        </p><pre>   
    class Person
    {
        std::string d_name;
        std::string d_address;
        std::string d_phone;
        
        public:
            ...
            bool read(std::istream &amp;in);
            void display() const;
            ...
    };
        
</pre>

    Programs (e.g., a <code>main</code> function) could now use <code>Person</code> objects:
        <pre>
    int main()
    {
        Person person;
        size_t count = 0;

        while (person.read())
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "Person " &lt;&lt; ++count &lt;&lt; ": ";
            person.display();
        }
    }
        
</pre>

    The implementation of the class <code>Person</code> and functions like
<code>readPerson</code> are made available in some library (e.g., <code>libperson.a</code>) and
everybody can happily use <code>Person</code> and all additional functionality by
linking programs to the <code>libperson.a</code> library.
<p>
</p><p><strong>What's wrong with this design?</strong></p>
<p>
The problem is that originally the designers of <code>Person</code> thought they had it
all right, but time passes, and now almost everybody has a cellphone and an
e-mail address. So the class designers publishes an update, and
<code>libperson.a</code> version 2 is released. Now <code>Person</code> also offers facilities
for storing/retrieving cellphone numbers and e-mail addresses, and the updated
class <code>Person</code> starts like this:
        </p><pre>
    class Person
    {
        std::string d_name;
        std::string d_address;
        std::string d_phone;
        std::string d_cellphone;
        std::string d_eMailAddress;
        
        public:
            ...
    };
        
</pre>

    Users of the class <code>Person</code> have their own libraries (using <code>Person</code>
objects (e.g. libmylib.a)) , and <code>main.o</code> is also available. The joy and fun
of using libraries is that we don't have to recompile everything time and
again. And this time a new program can simply be created by linking the
existing software to the new library:
        <pre>
    g++ -o personhandler main.o -lmylib -lperson
        
</pre>

<p>
This, however, results in a big disappointment: the new program crashes
(or at least shows incoherent and unexpected results).
</p><p>
The unexpected results are caused by the new release breaking the class's 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface">Application Binary Interface</a> (ABI), not to
be confused with the class's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">Application Programming Interface</a> (API)
</p><p>
When the ABI breaks, existing software (e.g., object modules, or programs
using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_%28computing%29#Shared_libraries">shared libraries</a>)
 can no longer directly be used anymore when a new release of a library is
published. When the API breaks, existing software can no longer be compiled
anymore (e.g., the member <code>Person::read</code> is replaced by
<code>Person::extract</code>). 
</p><p>
Good library design requires that both API and ABI breakages are prevented.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>The Pimpl approach</strong></p>
<p>
ABI breakages can be prevented by using a <em>pimpl</em> design. <em>Pimpl</em> meaning
`pointer to the implementation'. Using the pimpl design the class's public
interface (defined in some class <code>class MyClass</code>, like <code>class Person</code>) is
separated from the class's data and private interface (defined in <code>class
MyClassImp</code>, like <code>class PersonImp</code>). Users never access <code>PersonImp</code>
directly. Instead, all communication is routed through the class offering the
public interface (<code>MyClass</code>, e.g., <code>Person</code>).
</p><p>
The class interface only has one data member: <code>MyClassImp *d_pimpl</code>; all
its members call identically named members in the class <code>MyClassImp</code>, and
its constructors initialize the <code>d_pimpl</code> data member to a newly allocated
<code>MyClassImp</code> object. The <code>...Imp</code> class implements all the real work. It
may define private members implementing subtasks, it may define as many data
members it needs, and its public interface offers the same members as the main
class does.
</p><p>
At any time the <code>...Imp</code> class may be modified: new members may be added,
existing members may be renamed or redefined, data members may be added,
reordered, or removed: nothing will break either the main class's ABI or API.
</p><p>
The main class's public interface may only be extended: new members may be
added. Changing the signatures of exising members breaks the class's API. No
new data members may be added to the main class, as this will break the
class's ABI. 
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Assignment</strong></p>
<p>
 <a href="https://www.icce.rug.nl/edu/1/pointers1/data.tgz">Here</a> 
    you find  a basic implementation of the class
<code>Data</code> and a program using a <code>Data</code> object. It can be used to complete
this exercise. 
    </p><ul>
    <li> create a library <code>libdata.a</code> and use the provided main function
defining a local <code>Data</code> object. Compile <code>main.cc</code> to an object file. Link
<code>main.o</code> against <code>libdata.a</code> and show that the program runs OK (let the
program read <code>data.in</code> by redirecting the standard input stream; submit the
commands used to create the library, to compile <code>main.cc</code>, and to link
<code>main.o</code> against the library. Use separate commands for compiling
<code>main.cc</code> and linking <code>main.o</code>).
    </li><li> create a new version of the library, after uncommenting the
definition of <code>d_text</code> in <code>data/data.h</code> and its use in
<code>data/read.cc</code>. Link the new library to the <em>existing</em> <code>main.o</code> and show
that the program no longer runs OK.
    </li><li> Convert the original class to a class using a pointer to the
implementation. Redo the first two steps, and show that both programs run
OK.

        <strong>Exercise 41.</strong>
        <br>
        (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: improve your understanding of the pimpl approach
<p>
Answer the following questions:
    </p><ul>
    <li> Why breaks the program after creating the new library in step 2 of
the previous exercise?
    </li><li> Why doesn't the program break anymore when using a pointer to the
implementation? 
    </li><li> Assume you design a class which is published in a library which is
made available to the world. You're pretty sure your class is absolutely right
and complete, so there's no need for using the pimpl approach. But shit
happens, and three years later you realize that you actually do need to define
two additional data members in your class. How can these additional data
members be added to your class without breaking the ABI? (Your answer should
offer a generic approach you can use allowing you to avoid ABI breakages for
any class you design, which do not use the pimpl approach).
    </li></ul>
    You earn two points for completing this exercise.
<p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    Notes:
    </p><ul>
    <li> The original <code>data.h</code> and <code>data.ih</code> header files should be
cleaned up: the <code>string</code> and <code>iostream</code> headers should no longer be
included. <code>Data.h</code> itself only needs to declare `<code>class DataImp;</code>'.
    </li><li> When changing <code>DataImp</code> after constructing the initial program,
realize that all sources of both <code>Data</code> and <code>DataImp</code> must be recompiled:
ABI breaks are prevented, as the already existing <code>main.o</code> file must <em>not</em>
be recompiled.
    </li><li> There is no nice solution to this problem. If your class already
contains a pointer, it can be changed to a pimpl, and all new members can be
harbored in a <code>ClassPimpl</code> class. In practice, if your class contains at
least two data members (or one data member which has at least the size of a
pointer [note that an <code>int</code> doesn't qualify, but a <code>long long</code> does]), one
can be <em>cast</em> to a pimpl, embedding the cast in a private member <code>pimpl</code>
like this:
        <pre>    #ifndef INCLUDED_DATA_
    #define INCLUDED_DATA_

    class DataImp;          // header file not needed

    class Data
    {
        long long d_value;

        public:
            Data();
            bool read();
            void display() const; 

        private:
            DataImp *pimpl() const;
    };

    inline DataImp *Data::pimpl() const
    {
        return reinterpret_cast&lt;DataImp *&gt;(d_value);
    }

    #endif

</pre>

<p>
The constructor could initialize the data member like this:
        </p><pre>    #include "data.ih"

    Data::Data()
    {
            // first, force the interpretation of d_value's address as the address
            // of a pointer to a DataImp 
        DataImp **dip = reinterpret_cast&lt;DataImp **&gt;(&amp;d_value);

            // then assign to that `pointer', the address of a new DataImp
            // (so the new DataImp's address is stored at d_value)
        *dip = new DataImp;
    }

</pre>

<p>
To call a member in the <code>DataImp</code> class use invocations like this:
        </p><pre>    #include "data.ih"

    bool Data::read()
    {   
        return pimpl()-&gt;read();
    }

</pre>

<p>
</p></li></ul>
