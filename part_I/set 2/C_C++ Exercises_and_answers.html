<h1>Chapter 2: Set two: Flow Control. Deadline: September 28</h1>
            <br><br>
<p>
General Advice: Various <em>standard C/C++</em>  functions exist that may be used
when solving exercises.
</p><p>
For such (standard) functions, the following simple rules apply:
    </p><ul>
    <li> If an exercise explicitly tells you to use a particular function,
that function must (of course) be used to complete the exercise.
    </li><li> For several tasks standard functions are available. Starting next
week we'll be able to define our own functions. However, when standard
functions exist you should <em>not</em> develop a comparable function
yourself. Don't reinvent the wheel. Visit our <a href="https://www.icce.rug.nl/edu/1/manpages">manpages</a> overview for an
overview and description of functions that are useful for this course (now or
at some future moment in time).
    </li></ul>
<p>
Some suggestions:
    </p><ul>
    <li> String-operations should be performed using <code>std::string</code>
objects; 
<p>
<em>Caveat:</em> in the Annotations (&lt;= 10.8.1) one string-object constructor is
currently not mentioned:
        </p><pre>
string(std::initializer_list&lt;char&gt; chars);
        
</pre>

    This constructor allows you to define a string object by specifying its
(separate) characters, like <code>string hi{ 'h', 'i' };</code>. However, there's also
a constructor <code>string(size_t count, char ch)</code>, constructing a string object
consisting of <code>count ch</code> characters. Be careful <em>not</em> to use the curly
braces constructor when you intend to use this latter constructor, as the
compiler will use the <code>initializer_list</code> constructor instead. So:
        <pre>
    string oops{ 1, 'x' };  // ERROR: defines oops as a string having 2 chars: 
                            // ascii 1 and 'x'

    string ok(1, 'x');      // OK: ok is a string having 1 character: 'x'
        
</pre>

<p>
</p></li><li> Functions whose names start with <em>is...()</em>, should be used to find
the category a certain character value belongs to. E.g., letters, digits,
punctuation marks, white space;
<p>
</p></li><li> For <em>input and output</em> <code>iostream</code> objects must be used. For
now, use <code>cin</code> for input, and <code>cout</code> for output. Do <em>not</em> use the
<strong>C</strong>-functions <code>printf, scanf</code> or their relatives.
    </li></ul>
<p>
To find out which (standard) functions exist, consult books, or use
on-line manuals. On <em>Unix</em> systems you can use the man-pages or the
info-reader. Other systems offer comparable documentation sources. Many
man-pages are available at the course's restricted section: <a href="https://www.icce.rug.nl/edu/1/manpages">manpages</a>. If
a function is not mentioned there, it's unlikely that you need it for this
course.
</p><p>
Experience shows that all reference information is already available on
your computer; buying reference books therefore is something of the past.
Very good references can also be found on-line (e.g.,
<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/">cppreference</a>). Sooner or later you 
develop a mental picture of available functions, and you only occasionally
have to refer to their man-pages.
</p><p>
Be careful that you're not developing a brain-dead searching habit. Don't
go to these references before you've studied the subject matter. <em>First</em>
study the Annotations, <em>then</em> resort to references, if necessary.
</p><p>
The more up-to-date your mental picture is, the better and faster you can
develop programs, as you will be able to use existing software, developed and
debugged by others (be)for(e) you.  This philosophy is present in <strong>C++</strong> even
stronger than in <strong>C</strong>, so get used to it quickly.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
    <li> In programs developed during this part of the course, erroneous
<em>input</em> need not be considered, unless the exercise explicitly asks you to
do so. So, if a program expects a number, your code does not have to <em>check</em>
for numeric input.
<p>
We know the position we take here is dangerous, as <em>many</em> sources of
errors in programs result from unchecked input and arguments. Although
programs <em>should</em> rigorously check their input, doing so in the
realm of our exercises often hides the actual purpose of the exercises.  Hence
we ordinarily do without, knowing that error handling will be covered later
in this course.
</p><p>
</p></li><li> Programs needed to solve the exercises are usually fairly small. If
you think a lot of code is required to solve a particular exercise, <em>think
again</em>: you're probably doing something wrong.
<p>
</p></li><li> When writing programs reading text files you may assume that the last
line is properly terminated by a newline character, unless explicitly
indicated otherwise.
<p>
</p></li><li> Often we use objects from the so-called standard namespace (e.g.,
<code>std::cout</code>, <code>std::string</code>). If your source files contain a line
        <pre>
    using namespace std;
        
</pre>

    just before the actual source code starts, then the <code>std::</code> prefixes may
be <em>omitted</em> when referring to entities from that namespace. 
    </li></ul>
<p>

        <strong>Exercise 10.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: create a program producing a multiplication table
<p>
Remember primary school? You had to learn by heart the multiplication
tables. In this little program we're going to do that again, but diffeently.
</p><p>
Design a program that is called from the command-line with one argument: a
numeric positive integral value for which the program should display the
multiplication table. 
</p><p>
You may assume that the argument that's passed to the program is indeed a
positive integral value.
</p><p>
For example, starting the program as <code>a.out 7</code> must produce:
    </p><pre>
    1 * 7 = 7
    2 * 7 = 14
    3 * 7 = 21
    4 * 7 = 28
    5 * 7 = 35
    6 * 7 = 42
    7 * 7 = 49
    8 * 7 = 56
    9 * 7 = 63
    10 * 7 = 70
    
</pre>

<p>
Hints: make sure you localize. Also, avoid IRE.
</p><p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    Notes:
    </p><ul>
    <li> The <code>stoul</code> function (see the <code>Strings</code> chapter in the
Annotations) is used to convert a textual representation of the table's factor
to a numeric value.
    </li><li> An (almost) canonical <code>for</code> statmement is used. The <code>for</code> stmnt
should be used since the number of iterations is known, but multiplication
tables use natural numbers, rather than indices, so the increment part is done
at the beginning, and not in the standard inc-section at the end.
    </li></ul>
    <pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
        // in general, prefer the canonical form. In this case, 
        // add 1 to indices (0 to 10) to modify the canonical form so it
        // iterates from 0 + 1 to 10 + 1, because multiplication tables are
        // commonly using the world of numbers.

                                   // using the canonical form for numbers
    for (size_t factor = 1, value = stoul(argv[1]); factor != 11; ++factor)
        cout &lt;&lt; factor &lt;&lt; " * " &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; " = " &lt;&lt; factor * value &lt;&lt; '\n';
}

        <strong>Exercise 11.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to apply a standard type in a non-standard
way.
<p>
Design a program showing all combinations of all the program's command
line arguments (not using the program name itself). Each combination should be
displayed on a numbered line. The first line should be empty (none of the
arguments are shown), the last one should show all the program's arguments.
</p><p>
Hints: 
    </p><ul>
    <li> this exercise is extremely simple: think about how values are stored
        in the bits of an integral-typed variable like an <code>int</code>.
    </li><li> Localize as much as possible.
    </li><li> Be aware of IRE!
    </li><li> In case you're tempted: floating point values are nowhere necessary.
    </li><li> A bit premature: to skip the program name do <code>++argv</code>
            as 1st statement in <code>main</code>.
    </li></ul>
<p>
Example:
        </p><pre>
    a.out if then else
    1: 
    2: if 
    3: then 
    4: if then 
    5: else 
    6: if else 
    7: then else 
    8: if then else

        <strong>Exercise 12.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to design an interactive program.
<p>
Below high-level languages the world of assembly language is encountered. What
does an assembly language look like? 
</p><p>
One essential element is that all instructions are very simple, like <code>mul x,
y</code> to multiply two values together, but not <code>stoul(text)</code> to convert a piece
of text to a number.
</p><p>
In this program we develop an extremely basic interactive program, somewhat
mimicking assembly language. Its instructions are:
        </p><pre>
    sto x       -- save (store) the value x in the program's variable
                    (there is only one variable, initially 0)
    add x       -- add x to the program's variable
    sub x       -- subtract x from the program's variable
    mul x       -- multiply the program's variable by x
    div x       -- divide the program's variable by x
    ret         -- return: end the program
        
</pre>

    All values are integral numbers (no need to test for this), but division
by 0 must be prevented, so 'div' must inspect x's value before the division is
performed. If <code>x == 0</code> then an error message must be issued, after which the
program continues. On the other hand, the program must check whether the
received instruction is a known instruction. A command like
        <pre>
    store 5
        
</pre>

    therefore must be recognized as an unknown instruction, and the program
should display
        <pre>
    No instruction `store'
        
</pre>

    followed by the next prompt.
<p>
After each successful step the latest value of the variable is displayed.
A prompt (<code>&gt;</code>) is displayed when the program is ready to accept input
(empty lines are OK, but do not result in new prompts). 
</p><p>
Hints:
    </p><ul>
    <li> This is an interactive program, and so a <code>while</code> might be the
        indicated repetition statement;
    </li><li> Because there are alternatives based on the same variable
        (expression), use a switch, rather than an if-else ladder to find
        which instruction is requested;
    </li><li> `Turn things around': if you decide at the top of the <code>while</code>,
        rather than at the end of the <code>switch</code>, what you should do, your
        program becomes smaller resulting in a flow that's easy to grasp;
    </li><li> Mind the layout, and use (semantic) end-of-line comment to briefly
        indicate what the purpose of core statements are. Do not hesitate to
        insert empty lines to separate semantically different parts of your
        program.
    </li></ul>

    </p><pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

// see below for an alternative approach

                            // the switch, but are modified hereafter.
                            // therefore they are not be further localized.
    string instruction;
    int variable = 0;       // the variable must be outside of the 'while'
                            // stmnt, since it's used again and again.

    string mnemonics{"add mul div sto sub"};

    while (true)            // interactive programs don't know how
    {                       // many lines to process, so use 'while'

                    variable /= arg;
                    break;
                }
                cout &lt;&lt; "division by 0 not defined\n";
            continue;               // continue belongs to the while: back to

        }
        cout &lt;&lt; "   " &lt;&lt; variable &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
}

/*
    One of the solutions we received didn't have to check for the correct
    instruction size, and didn't have to inspect the 3rd character: it 
    would also work with commands that aren't unique in their third letters.

    Approach: separately compute the base 36 values of the commands. For this
    you can use, e.g., stoul("sto", 0, 36) when computing the base 36 value of
    the command "sto". 

    These values can be collected in an enum, like so:

    enum
    {
        ADD = 13441,        // base 36 value of "add"
        ...
        STO = 37356,        // base 36 value of "sto"
    };


    Then extract the command and compute its base 36 value to determine what
    to do. E.g.,

    cin &gt;&gt; instruction;

    if (instruction == "ret")
        return 0;

    // get the argument

    switch (stoul(instruction, 0, 36))
    {
        case ADD:
            ...
        break;

        ...

        default:
            cout &lt;&lt; "Instruction " &lt;&lt; instruction &lt;&lt; " not supported\n";
        break;
    }

        <strong>Exercise 13.</strong>
        <br>
            Purpose of this exercise: contrast a correct way to read a file with an
incorrect way.
<p>
Create a simple program displaying the number of lines it reads from its
standard input. If the command-line argument <code>ok</code> is provided it should use
the correct (standard) form for reading files. 
</p><p>
If the command line argument <code>ok</code> is not provided, it should prematurely
test whether lines were successfully read (consequently, it will print a
value which is one too large). 
</p><p>
The program can easily be tested by entering a couple of lines using your
keyboard, terminating the input using ctrl-D.
</p><p>
Note: the correct form <em>must</em> use an eternal loop, the incorrect form
<em>must</em> use a form in which <code>EOF</code> is tested before (instead of after)
reading the file.
</p><p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br></p><pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 14.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: introduce and learn to write a simple filter.
<p>
A <em>filter</em> is a program reading its information from the standard input,
writing its output to the standard output. Many filters exist, e.g.,
<strong>sed</strong>(1), <strong>cat</strong>(1), <strong>(g)awk</strong>(1), <strong>gpg</strong>(1), to name a few.
</p><p>
In this exercise develop a filter that removes empty lines existing at the
beginning of <code>cin</code> and at the end of <code>cin</code>. A line is not empty if it
contains at least one non-blank character.  If an empty line contains blank
characters then those characters can be ignored when writing that empty line
to the standard output stream.
</p><p>
The venom of this exercise is (literally) in its tail: how do you know whether
a bunch of empty lines are indeed at the end? 
</p><p>
Caveats: we <em>haven't</em> covered arrays of undetermined sizes yet, so you can't
store lines in an array, and you're <em>not</em> supposed to adopt the
Perl approach, where you first read in the full file, and then process
what you've got. Using a <code>std::string</code> variable is OK, but that variable may
never contain more than one line read from the standard input.
</p><p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    The key to the solution is to count: when encountering empty lines, count
them. If a non-empty line appears thereafter, simply print `<code>nEmpty</code>' empty
lines first, and reset <code>nEmpty</code> to 0.
</p><p>
</p><pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    string line;

    while (true)        // find the first non-empty line
    {
        if (!getline(cin, line))
            return 0;   // All lines were empty
			
        if (line.find_first_not_of(" \t") != string::npos)  // non-empty line
            break;

        <strong>Exercise 15.</strong>
        <br>
        (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: learn to think about inserting values
<p>
It looks so easy: inserting a value into <code>cout</code> using the octal, decimal or
hexadecimal number system. But can you do it yourself?
</p><p>
This exercise focueses on inserting numbers in a certain number system.
</p><p>
Number systems beyond 9 use letters for representing values. Let's allow all
number systems from binary to a number system using base (radix) 36: 10 digits
plus 26 (lower case) letters.
</p><p>
Write a program that expects two (decimal) numbers on the command line. The
first one is the radix used for displaying the second number.
</p><p>
Examples:
        </p><pre>
    $ number 5 34
    34, displayed using radix 5 is: 114
    $ number 21 34
    34, displayed using radix 21 is: 1d
    $ number 16 57005
    57005, displayed using radix 16 is: dead
    $ number 30 0
    0, displayed using radix 30 is: 0
        
</pre>

<p>
Hints and caveats:
    </p><ul>
    <li> For those who have previous programming experience: no functions!
    </li><li> To determine the <em>last</em> digit of a <code>value</code> in a number system
        using <code>radix</code> compute <code>value % radix</code>. The last but one digit uses
        the same computation, but then on the value <code>value / radix</code>.
    </li></ul>
<p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    Here is our program:
        </p><pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    string accumulate;                      // stores the converted number
    
    size_t radix = stoul(argv[1]);          // get the radix and the value
    size_t value = stoul(argv[2]);          // to display in that radix
    do
    {
        size_t ch = value % radix;          // get the last digit
        value /= radix;                     // cut off the last digit

        ch += ch &lt; 10 ? '0' : 'a' - 10;     // convert ch to a
                                            // char-representation 

        accumulate.insert(0, 1, ch);        // insert the digit before other
                                            // digit 
    }
    while (value);                          // done when value has decayed to 
                                            // 0

    cout &lt;&lt; argv[2] &lt;&lt; ", displayed using radix " &lt;&lt; argv[1] &lt;&lt; " is: " &lt;&lt; 
            accumulate &lt;&lt; '\n';
}

<p>
Note that this is also an interesting case where a <em>do-while</em> loop
should be used, as the loop must at least be executed once.

</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 16.</strong>
        <br>
        (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: learn to implement a well-known utility program
<p>
The program <strong>wc</strong>(1) is a well-known utility counting bytes, words or lines
in a file.
</p><p>
In this exercise you're developing your own verion of <code>wc</code>. Your program
reads its standard input stream (<code>std::cin</code>) and depending on its
command-line argument it 
    </p><ul>
    <li> displays the number of bytes in cin if the argument starts with 'b';
    </li><li> displays the number of words in cin if the argument starts with 'w';
    </li><li> displays the number of lines in cin if the argument starts with 'l';
    </li><li> displays an error message if the argument starts with another
        character. You may assume that at least 1 argument was provided.
    </li></ul>
<p>
Counting the number of bytes is easy. Use <code>cin.get()</code> (see the Annotations,
chapter 6, for a description of this function).
</p><p>
Counting words is a bit more complicated. Fortunately, extracting <code>string</code>
objects from <code>cin</code> does the job.
</p><p>
Counting lines also isn't trivial. For now, the function <code>getline</code> returns
<code>true</code> unless there's no info on <code>cin</code> available anymore. When returning
<code>true</code> <code>cin.eof()</code> may be inspected to see if a trailing newline character
was actually encountered.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
    <li> Implement your <code>wc</code> program. Let it operate on itself, and show
that your program and the existing <strong>wc</strong>(1) program produce identical
outputs. Submit your program and this output.
    </li><li> CAVEAT: If you do <code>echo -n 'hello world' | wc -l</code> the standard
<code>wc</code> program (and <em>your</em> program!) returns 0. Explain.
    </li></ul>
    Example: our program (and <strong>wc</strong>(1) shows the following output:
    <pre>
    a.out b &lt; wc.cc ; wc -c &lt; wc.cc
    991 bytes
    991
    
    a.out w &lt; wc.cc ; wc -w &lt; wc.cc
    112 words
    112
        
    a.out l &lt; wc.cc ; wc -l &lt; wc.cc
    47 lines
    47
    
</pre>

<p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    <code>echo -n 'hello world' | wc -l</code> returns 0 because there's no newline
character trailing the input line. But some info was available, so <code>true</code> is
returned.  But then <code>cin.eof()</code> also returns <code>true</code>, ending the
line-counting.

        (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: think about flow control issues
<p>
Consider the following piece of code (the function <code>swap</code> swaps the contents
of its two character-variable arguments, the function <code>capitalize</code>
capitalizes the NTBS it receives as its argument). It may be assumed
that these functions always properly do their work, and that all required
declarations and headers were properly provided.

        cout &lt;&lt; argv[0] &lt;&lt; "'s arguments:\n";
    
        for (idx = 0; idx &lt; argc; ++idx)

        }
        while (next);

        reverse = argv[0];

        for (int idx = 0; idx &lt; reverse.length() / 2; ++idx)
            swap(reverse[idx], reverse[reverse.length() - 1 - idx]);

Answer the following questions (<em>be concise</em>, but always motivate your
answers):
    </p><ul>
    <li> Considering the source text, what do you think the author of the
program had in mind when he/she wrote the program?
    </li><li> What is your opinion of the shown program? 
    </li><li> Do you see ways to improve it? Be specific, and provide the improved
code. 
    </li></ul>
<p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    </p><ul>
    <li> Considering the source text, what do you think the author of the
program had in mind when he/she wrote the program?
<p>
Apparently the program should allow the user to capitalize some of the
command line arguments, followed by a reversed display of the program's
name. Initially the program displays the program's name and (supposedly) the
program's arguments.
</p><p>
</p></li><li> What is your opinion of the shown program? 
<p>
The program doesn't necessarily do what it advertises. Initially the
program's name is shown, followed by -again- the program's name, although the
suggestion is given that the program's actual <em>arguments</em> are
displayed. Assuming that the program has arguments. But it might as wel have
none, in which case the line about the program's arguments comes out a bit
silly. A `command line argument' is somewhat ambiguous. Literally it means the
program's name as well as its arguments, and it is not clear what's the
intention here. Rather remarkably, the program doesn't seem to do anything
useful with the the capitalized arguments as only the (revered) program name
itself is displayed.
</p><p>
</p></li><li> Do you see ways to improve it? Be specific.
<p>
</p><ul>
    <li> The variables can be localized. <code>nr</code> is used only on the do-loop;
<code>idx</code> should be defined as a loop control variable in the first <code>for</code>
statement; <code>next</code> could be omitted altogether by rewriting the do-loop, but
if used it has an initially undefined value;
<code>reverse</code> is only used at the end and should be defined where it gets it
<code>argv[0]</code> value.
    </li><li> The types of the <code>for</code>-loop control variables should be <code>size_t</code>
as their values are never negative.
    </li><li> Since the program supposedly does something with arguments, consider
ending it when no arguments are provided
    </li><li> The <code>for</code> statements should use their canonical forms. 
    </li><li> In the do-loop <code>nr</code>'s value isn't checked. An array bound excess
may be the result. 
    </li><li> The do-loop's flow should be reconsidered. <code>Next</code> is SF, and the
loop could better be written as a endless <code>while</code>:
        <pre>
    while (true)
    {
        ...
        if (nr == -1)
            break;
        ...
    }
        
</pre>

    </li><li> the second <code>for</code> statement repeatedly computes <code>reverse.length()
/ 2</code> although this never changes. Compute it once in the initialization phase
of the <code>for</code> stmnt. The same holds true for the computation of
<code>reverse.length() - 1</code>. 
    </li><li> However, it's silly to use <code>swap</code>. Here are two alternatives:
        <pre>
    for (
        auto begin = reverse.rbegin(), end = reverse.rend(); 
            begin != end;
                ++begin
    )
        cout &lt;&lt; *begin;
    cout &lt;&lt; '\n';
        
</pre>

<p>
or, simply:
        </p><pre>
    cout &lt;&lt; string(reverse.rbegin(), reverse.rend()) &lt;&lt; '\n';
        
</pre>

    </li></ul>
    </li><li> The <code>endl</code>s should be replaced by <code>'\n'</code>s.
</li></ul>
