        <strong>Exercise 61.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to create leak-free classes
<p>
In the exercises about pointers (i.e., pointers1 exercises) we encountered
the initial definition of the class <code>Strings</code>. Convert this basic class
<code>Strings</code> into a full-proof value-class. Submit the modified header and all
members that you added to make the class full-proof (So <em>don't</em> submit the
implementations of members like the already defined constructors and other
members implemented earlier).
</p><p>
If you think it's sensible to support move-operations: explain why and add
the required members. If you <em>don't</em> think it's sensible to support
move-operations: explain why.
</p><p>

        <strong>Exercise 62.</strong>
        <br>
        (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: learn to create leak-free classes
<p>
In the 2nd set of exercises about pointers (i.e., pointers2 exercises) we
encountered a refined definition of the class <code>Strings</code>, using double
pointers. Convert this refined <code>Strings</code> class to a full-proof value class
(cf. the previous exercise). Here, too, submit the class's header file and
only the implementations of members that are added merely for this exercise. 
</p><p>
If you think it's sensible to support move-operations for this class:
explain why and add the required members. If you <em>don't</em> think it's sensible
to support move-operations for this class: also explain why.

        <strong>Exercise 63.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to recognize situations where copy elision may
be active.
<p>
Construct a small class Demo. The class provides a constructor, a destructor,
copy and move constructors and overloaded copy and move assignment
operators. Their actions are irrelevant: for this exercise they may be
implemented in-class, but they should contain a short <code>cout</code> statement
showing them being called. 
</p><p>
Also construct a factory function <code>Demo factory()</code>. Illustrate, using
<em>small</em> code fragments,
    </p><ul>
    <li> a situation where copy elision is used
    </li><li> a situation where the move constructor is (or should be) used
    </li><li> a situation where the copy assignment is used
    </li><li> a situation where the move assignment is used
    </li></ul>
<p>
Hint: define a simple class where its constructors/assignment operators simply
display that they're called.

        <strong>Exercise 64.</strong>
        <br>
        
Purpose of this exercise: learn to handle matrices of different sizes.
<p>
Remember the slides of the first lecture about pointers? Slide 26 showed
square matrices of different sizes, noting that it's hard to process such
matrices by a single function. The solution was to turn to pointers to
pointers and passing relevant sizes to such a function. 
</p><p>
But there's an alternative, which is introduced in this exercise. In broad
terms, the solution consists of <em>encapsulation</em>!
</p><p>
In this exercise design and implement a class <code>Matrix</code>. Eventually this may
become a fairly elaborate class, but for now we keep it simple. Here are its
characteristics:
    </p><ul>
    <li> The elements of the matrix are <code>double</code> values.
    </li><li> All elements are retrievable (by the class's members) through a
        <code>double *d_data</code> data member. Furthermore, it has a <code>d_nRows</code> and
        a <code>d_nCols</code> data member holding, resp., the matrix's number of rows
        and number of columns.
    </li></ul>
    <ul>
    <li> There is a constructor expecting two arguments: the number of rows
        and the number of columns (nitializing the matrix with zeroes).
    </li><li> There is a constructor expecting an initializer list having row
        initializer lists containing  column double values (if  the
        latter initializer lists differ in length, then display a warning
        message and call <code>exit(1)</code>).<br>
        Hint: at some point you may want to access the address of 
        an <code>initializer_list's</code> first element. One way of doing that is
        (assuming <code>list</code> is an <code>initializer_list&lt;double&gt;</code>):
            <pre>
            double const *dptr = &amp;*list.begin();
            
</pre>

    </li><li> Do not define the default constructor, but it must be available,
        initializing its objects with 0 rows and 0 columns.
    </li><li> The class is a value-type of class.
    </li><li> The number of rows and the number of columns can be retrieved
        (<code>nRows()</code>, nCols()).
    </li><li> The member <code>row(size_t idx)</code> returns a pointer to the first element
        of row <code>idx</code>. There's also a const variant of this member.
    </li><li> A static factory function <code>identity(int dim)</code> returns a (square)
        identity matrix having <code>dim</code> rows and columns (the elements of an
        identity matrix are zeroes, except for its main diagonal (elements
        <code>[x][x]</code>), which are ones).
    </li><li> To transpose a matrix, the member <code>tr</code> transposes the current
        matrix (returning a reference to itself) <em>only</em> if the matrix is a
        square matrix. If the matrix is not a square matrix, call <code>exit(1)</code>
        after issuing an error message. The member <code>transpose</code> is a factory
        member returning a transposed copy of the current matrix (of any
        dimension).
    </li></ul>
<p>
Design and implement <code>Matrix</code>. Show that it's easy to implement a
        (single) function that changes a (square) <code>Matrix</code> of any dimension
        into an identity matrix (cf. slide 32, pointers-1). Submit your
        implementation of such a function as well.
</p><p>

        <strong>Exercise 65.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn that moving can also be useful for
non-temporary objects.
<p>
Consider the basic <code>Strings</code> class introduced in the 1st set of pointers. 
</p><p>
When a new string was added, new memory was allocated, and the existing
strings were copied to the newly allocated memory. 
</p><p>
Since we <em>know</em> that the old strings are no longer used, rather than copying
the old strings to their new locations we might consider moving them. The
class <code>strings</code> supports moving, and moving is OK (even though the old
strings aren't anonymous temporary objects), because classes are responsible
for their own integrity: if you move string <code>src</code> to string <code>dest</code>, then
<code>src's</code> contents will have disappeared, but the object (<code>src</code>) remains in
a valid state.
</p><p>
Since moving is faster than copying, using a move operation should result in a
more efficient program.
</p><p>
Extend the class <code>Strings</code> so that the memory extension procedure either
uses the standard (copy) procedure, or the string's move operation to transfer
the existing strings to their new locations. 
</p><p>
Add a constructor <code>Strings(size_t nIterate, bool copy = true)</code> preparing the
object for n iterations, either using copying (when <code>copy</code> is <code>true</code>) or
moving (when <code>copy</code> is <code>false</code>)
</p><p>
Select which method to use by specifying a pointer to a member that either
uses the copy operation or the move operation (adapt <code>add</code>, and rename
<code>enlarge</code> to <code>enlargeByCopy</code>; also create a member <code>enlargeByMove</code>).
The pointer is initialized by the mentioned constructor.
</p><p>
Also defined a member <code>iterate(char **environLike)</code> that expects a <code>char
**</code> argument (yes, like <code>environ</code>), which then performs the required number
of iterations using the requested method. Your <code>main</code> function should expect
at least one argument (the number of iterations) and optionally a second one,
in which case moving, rather than copying is used. The member <code>iterate</code>
should (for the benefit of the experiment) act rather dumbly: it does <em>not</em>
count the number of <code>environ's</code> elements, but repeatedly calls <code>add</code>. This
is then repeated <code>nIterations</code> times. Make sure that before each iteration
all allocated memory has been destroyed. After the iterations, all of
<code>environLike's</code> strings must be available: let your program display the
first and last elements of <code>environLike</code>, as stored by your <code>Strings</code>
object. 
</p><p>
Use the <strong>time</strong>(1) program to verify that moving is indeed faster
than copying.
</p><p>
Submit the modified header and all sources you have modified / created. Also
submit the results of your timing-experiments.
</p><p>

        <strong>Exercise 66.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpuse of this exercise: understand the need for using the <code>default</code>
keyword. 
<p>
The following types of constructors can be distinguished: default constructor,
copy constructor, move constructor, and all other constructors (considered a 
single category in this exercise). In addition we've encountered the
overloaded assignment operator, for which three variants are available: the
copy-assignment operator, the move assignment operator, and all other
assignment operators (also considered a single category). 
</p><p>
Fill out the entries in the following table: put a <code>-</code> in the cells where
the column element isn't provided by the compiler when you define the row
element (e.g., when you define the default constructor, the compiler doesn't
provide the default constructor, and so there's a - in that row/column
entry. Use the abbreviations for the copy and move constructors/assignment
operators (e.g., CC for the copy constructor) if the compiler will in fact use
that member instead of the column entry's default implementation.
