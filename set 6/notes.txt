SLIDES: POINTERS II
    Passing of array to function is always passing of a pointer. Therefore 
    a function should always take an array pointer as an argument.
        func(int *param[])
    instead of
        func(int param[])

    It follows from the previous that
        - The first dim of an array becomes a pointer in the function param
   
    Pointers to functions
        - Unknown action, to be performed repeatedly
        - syntax: always (*fp)(varargin)

    Considering why fp = &process; could be fp = process;? Its worse.

    Nice example of ternary operator abuse.
    int (*pf)(int) = mode == TOLOWER ? tolower :
                     mode == TOUPPER ? toupper :
                                       asIs    ;
    while (blabla)
        result = (*pf)(stuff)


    When NOT to use pointers to functions:
        - long switch where action is constantly re-determined
        - the action is not executed very often in series
            constantly rewriting the pointer sucks
            better to have a switch in this case
    
    function pointer 'switch':
        int (*transform[)(int ch) = 
        {
            &tolower, 
            &toupper,
            &asIs
        };
        for (int ch: allChars() )        // allChars has .end .begin iterators
            cout << (*transform[mode])(ch);
        Note:
            transform is an array of pointers to functions from int to int.
            mode should be member of enum map to int
    Pointers to member functions
        void (Class:*fp)(int) = &class::function;
        here fp is a pointer into class to a member function of that class.
        
        two ways to go about your day:
        - (object.*fp)(12)  // pointer to member, object
        - (obPtr->*pp)(12)  // pointer to member, pointer to object
    
    Pointer Array to Members 
        Just like the pointer switch above, you can have an array of pointers
        to member functions.
        - Normally as a static member
        - Class::*Class::arrayfunc(...)             // class function to class pointer

    Destructor
        Class String
        {
            public:
                ~String();
        }
        ~String()
        {
            delete[] d_str;
        }
        - plain data members are never destroyed
        - references         are never destroyed
        - place holder ptrs  are never destroyed
        
        delete
            - calls destructor of pointed to object
                    delete memory allocated by object
            - de-allocates memory containing the object
        
        delete[]
            - delete for all objects in array
        
        new
            - allocates bytes of memory
            - calls constructor

        Resizing is bad.
        Moving is better.

        Placement new
            - Only construct when necessary, in already available raw memory.
            - Raw memory may be pre-allocated in large chunks ready for later use.
            - Used in classes.
            - explicit destruction of objects.
            Prototype:
                void demo()
                {
                    char block[10 * sizeof(std::string)]
                    ..
                    string *sp = new(block + idx * sizeof(std::string))
                                    std::string("in block");
                };
                - block is raw memory(bytes = chars)
                - no automatic destruction at end of main
                - call sp->~string() to delete
            castable raw memory is easier:
            int main()
            {
                string *block = static_cast<string *>(
                                operator new(10 * sizeof(std::string)));

QUESTIONS: 
    1. When a function takes a pointer to an array (possibly passed using the 
    name of the array), is the size of the array communicated?

        int x[20];
    means x = [x1 x2 ... x20]
    The pointer x does not know the size of the array, only its type.

    2. The book says I should call the array 'char mat[10][80' using fun(char (*mat)[80]). 
                   Why not use fun(char **mat)?
    
    mat is an array of arrays. To pass it, we convert it's name to a function. Hence
    we obtain a pointer to an array of chars. Dereferencing an array of chars makes
    no sense and there is no automatic conversion here. Thus, the second size (80)
    is known in the function and can be determined compile time using sizeof() * typesize, whereas
    the first size is not known in the function. Pointers destroy size information of
    arrays.

NOTES:
    A static member of a class is defined for the whole class once, not for each instance.
    "When we declare a member of a class as static it means no matter how many objects of 
    the class are created, there is only one copy of the static member."
    - can't be defined inside the class header
    - should be declared inside the class header
    - can only acces static data members, functions
    - correct way to test if instances created (or count them)
