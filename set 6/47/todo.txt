3 switches:
    store.cc
        lhs is operand struct
        lhs.type is OperandType (found in enums.h)  // keep this
        sets memory/register                         
    
        Can I create an array of function pointers? The functions don't have identical parameters. Could modifiy to make that they do?

    start.cc
        takes oppcode from tokenizer
        calls corresponding function
    dereference.cc
        takes value.type
        returns register or memory value
