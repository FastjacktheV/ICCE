Exercise 42

Problem statement:
What are the variants of new/delete? For each of the variants provide a (short!)
example in which the used new/delete is appropriate and provide a short 
explanation why it is appropriately used.

Solution:

new/delete
new is used to allocate memory for a primitive type or object. When allocating 
for an object it will call the object constructor. Example of new use:
    int *ptr = new int;
This allocation is appropriate when we want to allocate memory for a single int.

delete is used to deallocate memory that was allocated using new. If called on 
an object (not a primitive type) it will also call that objectsâ€™ destructor. 
Example of delete use:
    std::string *ptr = new std::string;
    delete ptr;
This is appropriate because delete is used on memory allocated using new.

new[], delete[]
new[] is used to allocate memory for arrays. Like new it is type-safe: the type
of the element has to be declared. Like new, it calls constructors. 
An example of using new:
    int *arrayOfInts = new int[20];

delete[] is used to delete memory allocated using new[]. Unlike new, new[] saves
the size of the array it allocates. delete[] uses this size to delete the array.
Also the destructors of the objects are called.
(If the array contains a primitive type no destructors are called. Therefore an 
array of pointers require manual destruction of whatever is pointed to.)
An example of delete[] usage:
    string *stringPointer = new string[550];
    delete[] stringPointer;
This is appropriate because delete[] is used on an array allocated using new[].

operator new, operator delete
operator new is used to allocate raw bytes of memory. To actually use this 
memory, a static cast is required. 
An example of using operator new:
    size_t *sp = static_cast<size_t *>(operator new(5 * sizeof(size_t)));
This is appropriate because operator new is used to allocate raw memory. Here we
first calculate the number of bytes needed for 5 size_t variables. We then 
allocate the memory. operator new does not care for types.
operator delete is used to deallocate memory that was allocated using operator 
new. Like operator new, operator delete does not care for types. Because 
operator new saves the number of bytes allocated, operator delete knows how much
memory to deallocate. operator delete does not call any destructors.
An example of using operator delete:
    string *sp = static_cast<string *>(operator new(5 * sizeof(string)));
    operator delete(sp);
This is appropriate because we are using operator delete to deallocate memory 
that was allocated using operator new.

placement new
placement new is found in <memory> and overloads new. Placement new is used to 
place objects in previously allocated memory. 
An example of using placement new:
    string *sp = static_cast<string *>(operator new(15 * sizeof(string)));
    new sp string("Donald Knuth");
This is appropriate because we are using operator new on memory of the correct 
type that was previously allocated. We have placed a single string in this 
memory, leaving room for 14 more.
