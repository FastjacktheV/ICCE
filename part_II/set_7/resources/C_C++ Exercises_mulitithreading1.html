<h1>Chapter 7: Exercises set seven: Multi-threading I. Deadline: Jan 25, 2018</h1>
            <br><br>
<p>
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 49.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to apply basic multi-threading
<p>
The sieve of Eratosthenes offers one way to find prime numbers. In this
exercise we'll use this sieve to execute a time intensive process while
another thread tells us that the program's busy.
</p><p>
Our program expects one argument: the number of primes we want the program to
compute. 
</p><p>
Eratosthenes' sieve can be implemented like this (a basic, not too efficient
implementation, but we don't care: the exercise is about threads, not about
finding primes):
    </p><ul>
    <li> Start with a vector of <code>size_t</code> values containing 2: our first
        prime number, and use <code>size_t next</code>, initialized to 3, as the next
        value to inspect.
    </li><li> While the size of the vector is smaller than the number of primes to
        find perform these steps:
        <ul>
        <li> if <code>next</code> is not divisible by the values in the primes-vector,
            then add <code>next</code> to the primes-vector
        </li><li> increment <code>next</code>
        </li></ul>
    </li></ul>
<p>
While the program is busy finding primes, a separate thread displays dots (one
dot every second) to <code>cerr</code> until prime-finding has finished. Then display
all primes to <code>cout</code>, followed by the prime-finding starting time, the
prime-finding ending time, and the number of seconds it took the program to
find the primes. So, your program
could produce output like this:
    </p><pre>
    tmp/bin/binary 20000
    ...
    2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 
    (etc)
    224711 224717 224729 224737 

    Starting time: Mon Jan  8 11:15:25 2018
    Ending time:   Mon Jan  8 11:15:28 2018
    Computation of 20000 primes took 3 seconds
        
</pre>

        <strong>Exercise 50.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to perform time conversions
<p>
To convert coarse time specifications (e.g., <code>hours{13}</code> to a fine-grained
time specifications (e.g., to minutes) is easy: show how you can do this
conversion using available <code>chrono</code> facilities.
</p><p>
The opposite is slightly more complex: to convert, e.g., seconds to hours you
need to divide by a conversion factor. Of course, the conversion factor should
not use magic numbers, but should use conversion factors that are obtained
using available <code>chrono</code> facilities. Using a time unit like <code>hours{1}</code> is
OK, however.
</p><p>
Your program should expect two numbers: the first number represents hours,
which must be converted to minutes; the second number represents seconds,
which must be converted to minutes.
</p><p>
<br><br>
    
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 51.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to use the chrono/clock facilities
<p>
Using the <code>now</code> function (available in <code>chrono</code>, display the 
current local and universal coordinated time (use <code>gmtime</code> for that).
</p><p>
Your program should also receive an argument: an integral number to which an
s, m, h (for seconds, minutes, hours) is appended. Add (or subtract) the
specified time (from <code>now</code>), and display the resulting time.
</p><p>
Use <code>put_time</code> to display the resulting times.
</p><p>
<br><br>
    
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 52.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to define a thread with objects that aren't
functors. 
<p>
Assume we have the following class:
        </p><pre>
    class Handler
    {
        public:
            void shift(std::ostream &amp;out, string const &amp;text);
    };
        
</pre>

<p>
Its <code>shift</code> member writes <code>text</code> as lines to <code>out</code>, each time shifting
the first letter to the last position, until all of text's letters have
appeared once in text's front position. So, with the word <code>mouse</code> we get
    </p><pre>
    mouse
    ousem
    usemo
    semou
    emous
        
</pre>

<p>
As <code>Handler</code> does not have a <code>void operator()</code> member, a <code>Handler</code>
object by itself cannot be passed to a <code>thread</code> constructor.
</p><p>
Design a program that expects the name of an output file and a text. Open
the output file, and run a thread calling the Handler's <code>shift</code> member.
</p><p>
Do this in two different ways (sequentially): first by defining a
<code>Handler</code> object in <code>main</code> and then passing it to a thread, and second, by
running a thread that itself defines a <code>Handler</code> object.
</p><p>
<br><br>
    
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 53.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to design a simple producer/consumer program.
<p>
When a <code>queue</code> is used in a multi-threaded program a mutex is required to
synchronize its access. Although it's possible to surround calls to queue
members with a mutex lock, this makes the programmer responsible for the
synchronization. It would be nice if the mutex could be embedded in the
queue's members themselves. 
</p><p>
This isn't simple: see the Annotations for a description of why the <code>pop</code>
member can't return the queue's front-element. 
</p><p>
Consider a class <code>Storage</code>: it contains a queue, into which strings can be
pushed and popped by two different threads. 
</p><p>
The most important element to consider are <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> and
<code>front</code>. While designing your class <code>Storage</code> you may have to alter the
signatures of one or more of the members of your class, as compared to
<code>std::queue</code>. By itself, <code>Storage</code> should define a <code>std::queue</code> data
member, so don't implement the queueing part yourself. If you modify a
signature <em>clearly</em> explain why you decided to do so.
</p><p>
One thread is provided by the <code>main</code> function itself: it reads lines from
cin (lines you enter), and pushes the lines into the queue.
</p><p>
A separate thread obtains the lines from the queue and writes the lines to a
file. The name of the file is passed to the thread.
</p><p>
The separate thread uses polling to find out whether something is available:
it sleeps for a second, then checks whether a line is available, and if so,
removes it from the thread.
</p><p>
Complications to solve:
    </p><ul>
    <li> Simultaneously writing and reading the queue must be prevented;
<p>
</p></li><li> Consider also what may happen if one thread adds element to the
        queue, and another thread removes elements from the queue. To the
        latter the queue may seem empty, but that might be because the former
        hasn't yet entered elements into the queue. So an empty queue may
        mean: we're done adding elements or as yet we haven't been able to
        push new elements into the queue. How would you distinguish between
        these two cases?
<p>
The separate thread must be informed when the main program has no
        more lines to insert into the queue. Merely ending <code>main</code> is not the
        right thing to do (why not?). A better solution is to provide the
        class <code>Storage</code> with a member <code>empty()</code>, returning true once the
        queue is empty and a data member <code>d_finished</code> is set to <code>true</code> by
        a member <code>finished</code>.
</p><p>
</p></li><li> Both the main program and the thread must have access to <code>Storage</code>,
        but the <code>Storage</code> object should be defined in <code>main</code>.
    </li></ul>
<p>
<br><br>
    
</p><p>
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 54.</strong>
        <br>
        (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: extend the previous program so that it uses 
multiple clients.
<p>
Extend the previous clients in such a way that an array of threads is
defined. The number of threads is determined from the number of file names
that are passed to <code>main</code>. Each thread should write to its own file (it is
assumed that all file names are different). 
</p><p>
The objects that ran as threads must have a member <code>size</code> returning the
number of lines that thread has captured. The objects' <code>size</code> members must
be called for the first until the last thread, only after all threads have
finished, and have joined <code>main</code>. 
</p><p>
<br><br>
    
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 55.</strong>
        <br>
        (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: learn to sort out the mess that output may become in
the face of threads.
<p>
Consider this main function, which uses threads:
        </p><pre>
    int main()
    {
        vector&lt;thread&gt; threads;
        for (size_t ix = 0; ix != 100; ++ix)
            threads.push_back(thread(f2));
    
        for (auto &amp;thread: threads)
            thread.join();
    }
        
</pre>

<p>
The threads are using these functions f1 and f2, which output to some kind of
wrapper around an ostream:
        </p><pre>
    void f1()
    {
        TSosWrap{ std::cout } &lt;&lt; "one " &lt;&lt; "two " &lt;&lt; "three ";
    }
        
    void f2()
    {
        TSosWrap tout{ std::cout };
        tout &lt;&lt; "four "  &lt;&lt; "five " &lt;&lt; "six ";
        f1();
        tout &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
        
</pre>
                                  
<p>
The wrapper, <code>TSosWrap</code>, uses a <code>PassOnStreamBuf</code>:
        </p><pre>
    class PassOnStreamBuf: public std::streambuf
    {
        std::ostream &amp;d_os;
        public:
            PassOnStreamBuf(std::ostream &amp;os);
            PassOnStreamBuf(PassOnStreamBuf &amp;&amp;tmp) = default;

            int overflow(int ch) override;
    };

    inline PassOnStreamBuf::PassOnStreamBuf(std::ostream &amp;os)
    : 
        d_os(os)
    {}

    inline int PassOnStreamBuf::overflow(int ch)
    {
        d_os.put(ch);
        return ch;
    }
        
</pre>

<p>
The wrapper itself is very simple:
        </p><pre>
    struct TSosWrap: private PassOnStreamBuf, public std::ostream
    {
        TSosWrap(std::ostream &amp;os);
        TSosWrap(TSosWrap const &amp;other) = delete;
        
        TSosWrap &amp;operator=(TSosWrap const &amp;other) = delete;
    };

    inline TSosWrap::TSosWrap(std::ostream &amp;os)
    : 
        PassOnStreamBuf(os),
        std::ostream(this)
    {}
        
</pre>

<p>
In fact, it's too simple. When the program is run, the output is a mess,
because the output from different <code>TSosWrap</code> objects will be mixed up.
Modify <code>TSosWrap</code> so that output that belongs together shows up together. In
this particular case that means: all output produced by <code>TSosWrap</code> objects
cannot be clobbered by the output produced by other <code>TSosWrap</code> objects.
</p><p>
In particular, this applies to non-temporary <code>TSosWrap</code> objects: while
existing, output produced by other <code>TSosWrap</code> objects will have to
wait. When such a <code>TSosWrap</code> object's) lifetime ends other (waiting)
<code>TSosWrap</code> objects may start producing output; if multiple <code>TSosWrap</code>
objects are waiting then one will be given the opportunity to produce output,
forcing the other objects to wait a little longer.
</p><p>
Caveat: notice that the function <code>f2</code> above defines a <code>TSosWrap</code> object
protecting <code>cout</code>. While alive, <code>f1</code> is called which itself defines a
<code>TSosWrap</code> object protecting <code>cout</code>. In this case <code>f1's TSosWrap</code> object
must of course (why?) not wait producing output until <code>f1's TSosWrap</code> ceases
to exist.
</p><p>
Note: after adding the <code>#includes</code> that are required for the above to
compile, the modification requires less than twenty lines. Ten is doable if
you don't count empty lines.
</p><p>
<br><br>
    
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 56.</strong>
        <br>
        (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: learn to design a small multi-threaded program,
passing reusable objects to threads.
<p>
Design a class <code>TaskThreads</code> whose constructor receives the program's
arguments. 
</p><p>
Its <code>run</code> member either runs tasks in parallel or sequentially.
</p><p>
The program's first argument is the name of a file to process. If a second
argument (any argument) is provided tasks are performed sequentially,
otherwise they are performed in parallel.
</p><p>
In addition to <code>TaskThreads</code> design a class <code>Task</code>.  When using
multithreading <em>only</em> <code>Task</code> objects are passed to threads. Therefore,
each object must be usable as a thread-function.
</p><p>
Task objects <em>must</em> be initialized in the <code>TaskThreads</code> header file as
an array of four <code>Task</code> objects:
    </p><ul>
    <li> One <code>Task</code> object counts the number of vowels (lower and uppercase);
    </li><li> One <code>Task</code> object counts the number of digits;
    </li><li> One <code>Task</code> object counts the number of hexadecimal digits;
    </li><li> One <code>Task</code> object counts the number of printable characters that are
        not spaces or alphanumeric characters (these are the punctuation
        characters).
    </li></ul>
    In addition, the <code>TaskThreads</code> object
must define an array of four <code>std::thread</code> objects in its header file.
<p>
The <code>Task</code> constructor expects a function allowing it to count a particular
set of characters (hint: use existing <code>is...</code> functions where available, or
design a dedicated function when not), and a (<code>char const *</code>) label
describing the name of the task it should perform (e.g. merely <code>"vowels"</code>
when the <code>Task</code> object counts vowels).
</p><p>
Caveats: 
    </p><ul>
    <li> as the name of the file to process is only available <em>after</em>
initializing the <code>Task</code> object, find a way to tell the <code>Task</code> objects the
name of the file they should process.
    </li><li> when passing an object to <code>std::thread</code> it receives a copy of that
object. That is not what you want
    </li></ul>
<p>
Once the threads have completed, the <code>Task</code> objects <code>count</code> members return
the number of times the characters encountered in the file to process,
matching the configured selection function, is returned. E.g., an object
<code>Task{isdigit, "digits"}</code> returns the number of digits that were found in
the file.
</p><p>
At the end of the program display the counts for each of the four categories
(also using their labels) and then display the the total time
the program needed to complete its tasks (for that use the
<code>TaskThreads::showTime</code> member).
