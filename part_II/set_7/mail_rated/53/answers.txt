exercise 53
- Consider also what may happen if one thread adds element to the queue, and 
another thread removes elements from the queue. To the latter the queue may 
seem empty, but that might be because the former hasn't yet entered elements 
into the queue. So an empty queue may mean: we're done adding elements or as 
yet we haven't been able to push new elements into the queue. How would you 
distinguish between these two cases?
    use a finished variable and set it by the adder.

- The separate thread must be informed when the main program has no more lines 
to insert into the queue. Merely ending main is not the right thing to do (why 
not?). 
    Because If main ends then the second thread also ends. it might be that not
    all lines are written to the file in the second thread. 

- Both the main program and the thread must have access to Storage, but the 
Storage object should be defined in main. 
    This is solved by passing a pointer to the storage object to the function 
    which runs the second thread.

Changes after first attempt:
front() now returns bool instead of a string. It returns false if d_queue is 
empty.
