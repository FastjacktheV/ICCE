        <strong>Exercise 11.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose: learn to appreciate catching references when throwing exceptions
<p>
Show that exception catchers catching objects result in additional copies
of thrown objects, compared to exception catchers catching references to
objects. Also show that when throwing objects or references copies of the
(referred to) objects are thrown.
</p><p>
Also answer the question whether `<code>throw;</code>' results in throwing the
currently available exception or a copy of that exception.
</p><p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
        </p><pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

class Object
{
    public:
        Object()
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "Created new object\n";
        }
        Object(Object const &amp;other)
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "Copied an object\n";
        }
        ~Object()
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "Destroyed an object\n";
        }
};

int main()
try
{
    try
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "About to throw an Object, caught by a catch(Object o) "
                                                        "catcher\n";
        Object obj;
        throw obj;      // throwing this: Object{} results in copy elision
                        // as the compiler knows that Object{} is temp.
    }
    catch(Object o)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "Caught the object, rethrowing it to a "
                            "catch(Object &amp;) catcher\n";
        throw;
    }
}
catch (Object &amp;o)
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "Caught the rethrown object\n";
}






</pre>

<p>
When this program is run, it produces the following output, showing that
    an additional copy is constructed when catching values, rather than
    references:
        </p><pre>
    About to throw an Object, caught by a catch(Object o) catcher
    Created new object
    Copied an object
    Caught the object, rethrowing it to a catch(Object &amp;) catcher
    Destroyed an object
    Caught the rethrown object
    Destroyed an object

        <strong>Exercise 12.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: study the way delete[] works
<p>
Design a simple class <code>MaxFour</code> (only a constructor and destructor need to
be implemented). Once four <code>MaxFour</code> objects have been constructed its
constructor should throw an exception showing <code>max. number of objects
reached</code>. 
</p><p>
Next write a small program in which an array of 10 <code>MaxFour</code> objects are to
be constructed. Show how you can destroy the already allocated objects once
you've caught the exception and explain why the solution is (so) simple.
</p><p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    The class <code>MaxFour</code> uses a static member to count the number of
allocated objects. If it would exceed 4 an exception is thrown. The destructor
shows that the object is destroyed and how many are left. To show that 
the memory in which the objects are initialized is properly destroyed, you
have two options:
    </p><ul>
    <li> Overload <code>operator new[]</code> and <code>operator delete[]</code>, showing what's
happening (<code>operator new</code> and <code>operator delete</code> could be overloaded as
well, but that's not required for this exercise).
    </li><li> Install the program <strong>valgrind</strong>(1)
(cf. <a href="http://valgrind.org/">valgrind</a>) (<strong>valgrind</strong>(1) is available in
many operating system distributions), and run your program as argument(s) to
<strong>valgrind</strong>(1). Installing <strong>valgrind</strong>(1) is a good idea anyway,
independently from this exercise, as it shows whether your program has any
memory leaks. Using <strong>valgrind</strong>(1) on the program without using the
overloaded operators <code>new[]</code> and <code>delete []</code> is shown below.
    </li></ul>
<p>
Here is <code>MaxFour</code>, including overloaded <code>operator new[]</code> and
<code>operator delete[]</code> (to reduce the size of the answer the program was
implemented in one single file), using in-class implementations:
        </p><pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

class MaxFour
{
    static size_t s_count;

    public:
        MaxFour()
        {
            if (s_count == 4)
                throw "Exception: max. 4 objects created";
            ++s_count;
        }

        MaxFour(MaxFour const &amp;other) = delete;     // no CC, MC and op=

        ~MaxFour()
        {
            cerr &lt;&lt; "destroyed object " &lt;&lt; s_count-- &lt;&lt; '\n';
        }

        void *operator new[](size_t size)
        {
            void *mem = ::operator new(size);
            cerr &lt;&lt; "allocating a block of memory at " &lt;&lt; mem &lt;&lt; '\n';
            return mem;
        }

        void operator delete[](void *mem)
        {
            cerr &lt;&lt; "returning the memory at " &lt;&lt; mem &lt;&lt; '\n';
            ::operator delete[](mem);
        }


    private:
};
        
size_t MaxFour::s_count = 0;


int main(int argc, char **argv)
try
{
    MaxFour *mf = new MaxFour[10];
}
catch (char const *txt)
{
    cerr &lt;&lt; txt &lt;&lt; '\n';
}
</pre>

<p>
This program shows:
    </p><pre>
    allocating a block of memory at 0x9573008
    destroyed object 4
    destroyed object 3
    destroyed object 2
    destroyed object 1
    returning the memory at 0x9573008
    Exception: max. 4 objects created
    
</pre>

which illustrates that the block of memory in which the <code>MaxFour</code> objects
would have been allocated is destroyed.
<p>
Running <strong>valgrind</strong> on the program without overload operators <code>new[]</code> and
<code>delete []</code> (calling <code>valgrind a.out</code>) results in:
</p><p>
</p><pre>
$ valgrind a.out

        <strong>Exercise 13.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to create an exception safe class
<p>
Earlier (part I, see also the exercises about allocation) we encountered the
<code>Matrix</code>. The code of this class can also be downloaded
<a href="https://www.icce.rug.nl/edu/2/overloading/matrix.tgz">here</a>.
</p><p>
The code of some members of the <code>Matrix</code> class might fail (some of them even
use <strong>exit</strong>(3)). Identify those points, and make sure that the matrix becomes
exception safe (or at least exception neutral).
</p><p>
For this exercise your may also look at the overloaded operators (see the
`overloading' exercises). If you correctly handle those additional functions,
then you receive a point for the next (optional) exercise.
</p><p>
<strong>Note:</strong> <code>operator[]</code> may fail due to an array bound excess. In line with
the standard semantics of the index operator this is acceptable. 
</p><p>
However, there should <em>also</em> be a matching <code>at</code> function which should do
array bound checking, throwing an exception if the index is out of bounds.
</p><p>
Make sure that the <code>at</code> function can be used like the index operator, so
also for the 2nd index (this is somewhat complex: if this part is correctly
implemented it earns you another point for the 2nd optional exercise following
this one). Here is an example showing what happens when using the <code>at</code>
members on a 5 x 3 matrix:
        </p><pre>
    cout &lt;&lt; "Element 3, 2 of mat: " &lt;&lt; mat[3][2] &lt;&lt; "\n"
            "same, using at(): " &lt;&lt; mat.at(3).at(2) &lt;&lt; '\n';    

    mat.at(3).at(2) = 12;

    cout &lt;&lt; "Element 3, 2 of mat after assiging to 12: " &lt;&lt; mat[3][2] &lt;&lt; "\n"
            "same, using at(): " &lt;&lt; mat.at(3).at(2) &lt;&lt; '\n';    

    cout &lt;&lt; "Exception when exceeding row index:\n";
    try
    {
        mat.at(30).at(2);
    }
    catch (exception const &amp;exc)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; exc.what() &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }

    cout &lt;&lt; "Exception when exceeding col index:\n";
    try
    {
        mat.at(3).at(20);
    }
    catch (exception const &amp;exc)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; exc.what() &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }

    /* Generated output:

        Element 3, 2 of mat: 8
        same, using at(): 8
        Element 3, 2 of mat after assiging to 12: 12
        same, using at(): 12
        Exception when exceeding row index:
        Row index (30) exceeded. nRows = 5
        Exception when exceeding col index:
        Col index (20) exceeded. nCols = 3
    */
        
</pre>

    Hint: let the first <code>at</code> return a <code>Row</code> object, defined as nested
class in Matrix, and define the 2nd <code>at</code> in <code>Row</code>.
<p>
A simpler (but non-standard) <code>at</code> implementation consists of an <code>at</code>
function expecting two index arguments: one for the row, one for the
column. If you skip the 2nd optional exercise, then the 1st optional exercise
should offer a <code>at(rowIdx, colIdx)</code> function, checking the indices.
</p><p>
The resulting <code>Matrix</code> class must offer the exception guarantees: explain
for each member function why this is true by adding a <strong>short</strong> explanatory
comment at the top of each source file.
</p><p>
Note: this exercise, which may require you to define some additional
members. Also, there are very few situations where your code actually has to
create and throw exceptions; usually you only have to be able to properly
handle exceptions thrown by, e.g., operator <code>new</code>.  Make sure that objects
of the class you submit for this exercise can safely be used in programs.
</p><p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
</p><p>
In <a href="https://www.icce.rug.nl/edu/2/exceptions/answers/matrix.tgz">this archive</a> you find the
sources of the modified class.

        <strong>Exercise 14.</strong>
        <br>
        (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: learn to create an exception safe class
<p>
If you cover the <code>Matrix's</code> overloaded operators in the previous
exercise (see the `overloading' exercises), making them exception safe, you
earn 1 point for this exercise.
</p><p>
If you do, then submit this exercise as a single line of text:

        <strong>Exercise 15.</strong>
        <br>
        (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: learn to create an exception safe class
<p>
If you correctly implement the single argument <code>at</code> members (see the main
exercise about <code>Matrix</code> then you earn 1 point for this exercise.
</p><p>
If you do, then submit this exercise as a single line of text: 
        </p><pre>
    See the Matrix exercise.

<br><br>
     
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 16.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn how to end a program safely.
<p>
Assume you're program is being executed at a deeply nested level. At that
point the program notices that further execution is pointless. Of course,
calling <code>exit(1)</code> is no option.
</p><p>
How do you end a program in such a situation? Your solution must be `bullet
proof' in that:
    </p><ul>
    <li> it ends the program by properly calling the destructors
        of any local object between <code>main</code> and your current execution
        level</li></ul>, 
    <li> it must be simple, without any possibility of confusion,
    </li><li> the program must stop.
    )
<p>
Make sure you also submit a small demo illustrating your findings.
</p><p>
Note: there are at least two ways of doing this. One is blunt, the other (the
one you should at least develop) is in theory not completely `bullet proof',
but in practice it is.
</p><p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    Solution: 
</p><p>
The blunt solution consists of calling <code>std::terminate</code>. The problem with
that, however, is that it doesn't handle the destruction of objects on the
stack. In that sense it's little better than using <code>exit</code>, and should be
avoided if you can.
</p><p>
The advocated solution consists of throwing an exception which is only caught
in <code>main</code>'s function try-block. In order to prevent confusion define an enum
which is not being used otherwise. E.g.,
        </p><pre>
    enum class Exit     // empty enum is OK, class is optional but advised
    {};
    
    int fun()           // this function is called at a deeply nested level    
    {
        if (someCondition())
            throw Exit();   // anonymous Exit value
    }

    int main()
    try
    {
        // any code, eventually calling fun
    }
    catch (Exit)
    {
        return 1;
    }
    // any other exception may be caught here
        
</pre>

<p>
Note that there's no 100% guarantee that this works. If at some
intermediate level you do something like this:
        </p><pre>
    void intermediate
    try
    {
        // somewhere here throw Exit() happens
    }
    catch (...)
    {
        // ignoring every exception here
    }
        
</pre>

    then the <code>Exit</code> doesn't reach main's try-block. But this situation
should not happen within library code providing hooks for  calling your own
functions. In all other cases it'll be your own code and so it's your
responsibility to avoid these kinds of sinkholes. A <code>throw;</code> in a <code>catch
(...)</code> clause would of course solve the problem. Anyway, the essence is to
create a specific enum which is not used elsewhere. By providing a catch
clause for enum in <code>main</code> you can normally be sure that the enum is only
caught there. 
<p>
<br><br>
    
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 17.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to understand how throw lists and noexept
work.
<p>
As noted, throw lists and <code>noexept</code> are enforced by the compiler. It's not
something that magically is enforced. But what is the compiler doing?
</p><p>
In this exercise design a little class <code>ShowExcepts</code> that has a constructor
that accepts an <code>int</code> and a pointer to a function expecting no arguments and
has a  <code>void</code> return type. The class has two functions:
    </p><ul>
    <li> <code>asAthrowList()</code>, that behaves like a function that specifies <code>throw
        int, std::string</code>, but doesn't use a throw list;
    </li><li> <code>asNoexcept()</code>, that calls the function passed to the object's
        constructor, and behaves like a function that uses <code>noexcept</code>, but
        doesn't use <code>noexcept</code>.
    </li></ul>
<p>
Submit your class and a small program (and its output) showing that your code
works as stated.
</p><p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
    <li> <code>asAthrowList()</code>, that behaves like a function that specifies <code>throw
        int, std::string</code>, but doesn't use a throw list;
<p>
The essence of this function is that it accepts the indicated
exceptions and throws a <code>runtime_error</code>  if not:
</p><p>
</p><pre>
    void asAthrowList()
    try
    {
        ...
    }
    catch (int)
    {
        throw;
    }
    catch (std::string const &amp;)
    {
        throw;
    }
    catch (...)
    {
        throw runtime_error("throw list violation");
    }
        
</pre>

<p>
</p></li><li> <code>asNoexcept()</code>, that call the function passed to the object's
        constructor, and behaves like a function that uses <code>noexcept</code>, but
        doesn't use <code>noexcept</code>.
<p>
This implementation is even simpler: any exception will terminate the
program:
    </p><pre>
    void asNoexcept()
    try
    {
        ...
    }
    catch(...)
    {
        terminate();
    }
        
</pre>
        
    </li></ul>
<p>
<br><br>
    
</p><p>
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 18.</strong>
        <br>
        (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: Learn to identify points where exceptions may be
thrown. 
<p>
Consider the following function and ask yourself at which points exceptions
<em>may</em> be thrown. Assume that the function cleanly compiles and that <code>cout</code>
does not throw exceptions.
        </p><pre>
    void fun()
    {
        X x;
        cout &lt;&lt; x;
        X *xp = new X(x);
        cout &lt;&lt; (x + *xp);
        delete xp;
    }
        
</pre>
 
    Hint: there are over 10 points in the above program where exceptions could
be thrown.
<p>
Submit your answer as a numbered list stating the sequence number, the piece
of code (the statement) that may throw an exception and a short (!)
explanation why the exception might be thrown. Some statements may generate
exceptions for multiple reasons: show each of them as a separate entry. Use
the following format when submitting this exercise: statement you would write
something like:
        </p><pre>
       statement   explanation
  1.   ....
  ...

  5.   throw x;    A copy of object x is thrown
                   Align comments requiring multiple
                   lines of text.

  6.   throw x;    Copying x may throw an exception
  ....
        
</pre>

    <br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    Several alternatives are related to inheritance. When the answer to this
exercise is submitted before inheritance was covered these alternatives are
not expected to appear in your answers. Otherwise they are expected and
rated. 
        <pre>
    1.  X x;                The default constructor may throw

    2.  cout &lt;&lt; x;          The insertion operator may throw for X
    3.  cout &lt;&lt; x;          X may be converted to some insertable type. 
                            The conversion may throw
    4.  cout &lt;&lt; x;          When X is converted to some insertable type Y: the
                            insertion operator may throw for Y
    5.  cout &lt;&lt; x;          X may be derived from some insertable type Y. 
                            Inserting Y may throw
    6.  cout &lt;&lt; x;          If value parameters were used: the
                            copy construction may throw

    7.  X *xp = new X(x);   X's copy constructor may throw
    8.  X *xp = new X(x);   the standard new (if used) may throw
    9.  X *xp = new X(x);   'X::operator new' may throw

   10.  cout &lt;&lt; (x + *xp);  operator+ may throw for two X type objects
   11.  cout &lt;&lt; (x + *xp);  operator+ may be defined for some convertible type
                            from X for its lhs. This operator may throw
   12.  cout &lt;&lt; (x + *xp);  In the above case: the conversion may throw
   13.  cout &lt;&lt; (x + *xp);  operator+ may be defined for some convertible type
                            from X for its rhs. This operator may throw
   14.  cout &lt;&lt; (x + *xp);  In the above case: the conversion may throw
   15.  cout &lt;&lt; (x + *xp);  with 9, 10 and 12: if value type parameters were
                            used: the copy construction may throw
   16.  cout &lt;&lt; (x + *xp);  operator+'s lhs may be defined for Y from 
                            which X was derived. This operator may throw
   17.  cout &lt;&lt; (x + *xp);  operator+'s rhs may be defined for Y from 
                            which X was derived. This operator may throw
   18.  cout &lt;&lt; (x + *xp);  operator+'s lhs and rhs may be defined for Y from 
                            which X was derived. This operator may throw
   19.  cout &lt;&lt; (x + *xp);  operator+'s lhs and/or rhs may be defined for Y 
                            from which X was derived. If the above functions
                            would define value parameters, Y's copy 
                            constructors might throw.
   20.  cout &lt;&lt; (x + *xp);  with 16..19: if value type parameters were
                            used: the copy construction may throw

    Note that `<code>delete xp</code>' may not throw as per the <strong>C++</strong>
standard. Formally it could throw but in that case it should formally also not
be considered a piece of <strong>C++</strong> code.
<p>
The essential part of this exercise is that you realize that exceptions
may occur in many situations, and that the reasons for exceptions may
not always be immediately clear when looking at the individual statements. As
a case in point: alternatives 10..20 all refer to the same statement, but each
has its unique opportunity for throwing exceptions.

        <strong>Exercise 19.</strong>
        <br>
        (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: learn to allocate memory offering the strong
guarantee.
<p>
Consider a <code>Strings</code> class using placement new to store <code>std::string</code>
objects. It has data members <code>std::string *d_str, size_t d_size</code> and
<code>size_t d_capacity</code>.
</p><p>
Implement a member <code>Strings &amp;Strings::add(std::string const *append, size_t
count)</code> adding <code>count</code> strings pointed at by <code>append</code> to the strings
maintained by the <code>Strings</code> object. Add a <em>small (!)</em> end-of-line comment
to each statement in <code>add</code> describing why the statement was used. The
comments should provide an explanation as to why the implementation offers the
strong guarantee.
</p><p>
Capacity must be doubled when <code>d_size + count &gt;= d_capacity</code>, and <code>add</code>
must throw an exception stating what went wrong if the addition
cannot be completed. Firthermore, <code>add</code> must offer the strong guarantee.
</p><p>
Caveat: this is harder to accomplish than it appears to be at first sight. 
</p><p>
You may use an existing <code>Strings</code> class (e.g., as developed during part
I). You may also use the following <code>Strings</code> interface, assuming that all
members, except for <code>add</code> have already been implemented:
        </p><pre>
#include &lt;iosfwd&gt;

class Strings
{
    std::string *d_str;
    size_t d_size;
    size_t d_capacity;        

    public:
        Strings();
        Strings(Strings const &amp;other);
        ~Strings();

        Strings &amp;operator=(Strings const &amp;rhs);

        Strings &amp;add(std::strings *append, size_t count);
};
        
</pre>

<p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    Here is the implementation of the member <code>add</code>:
</p><p>
</p><pre>#include "strings.ih"

void Strings::add(string const *append, size_t count)
{
    size_t required = d_size + count;           // required for the strings
    size_t capacity = safeCapacity(required);   // compute a safe capacity

    auto ptr = requiredMem(capacity);       // make sure there's enough
                                            // memory, initialize it for the 
                                            // existing strings

    install(ptr, append, count);            // install the strings to append

    // now we're save: update data members

    size_t idx = d_size;
    d_size += count;

    if (ptr == d_str)                       // and return if installed in
        return;                             // available memory

    d_capacity = capacity;                  // memory was enlarged

                            //  swap the strings from d_str, deleting the 
                            //  default strings originally at ptr
    for (; idx--; )
    {
        ptr[idx].swap(d_str[idx]);          // install by swapping
        d_str[idx].~string();               // delete the default constructed
                                            // strings
    }

    operator delete(d_str);                 // return useless memory
    d_str = ptr;                            // point to new memory
