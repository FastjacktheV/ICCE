Using 'throw 1', the code works fine. When changing this to 'throw 1.0', we get the following output:

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_exception'
  what():  std::bad_exception
Aborted (core dumped)

When we use the member function asNoexcept however, we get the following output:

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'double'
Aborted (core dumped)
