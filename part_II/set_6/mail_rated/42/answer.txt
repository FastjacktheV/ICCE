The reason why std::istream &operator>>(std::istream &istr, std::string &str);
does not work is because when operator++ is used on the istream iterator<string>
the std::istream &operator>>(std::istream &istr, std::string &str) is called,
because of Koenig lookup on operator++'s argument's types. This operator only
extracts one word from the stdin. line extracts a whole line from the stdin.
