The reason why std::istream &operator>>(std::istream &istr,std::string &str);
doesnâ€™t work is because when operator++ is used on the istream iterator<string>
the std::istream &operator>>(std::istream &istr, std::string &str); is called
which only extracts one word from the stdin. line extracts a whole line from the
stdin.
