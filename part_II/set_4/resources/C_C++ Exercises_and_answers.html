        <strong>Exercise 25.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose: learn to construct an <code>ostream</code> class.
<p>
Construct a class offering the same facilities as <code>ostream</code>, but
inserting its information into <em>two</em> files, whose <code>ostream</code>-objects are
passed to this class's constructor. So, if the class is called <code>BiStream</code>
the following should be possible:
        </p><pre>
    int main()
    {
        ofstream one("one");
        ofstream two("two");

        BiStream ms(one, two);

        ms &lt;&lt; "Hello world" &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
        
</pre>

    This should insert the text <code>hello world</code> in both <code>one</code> and <code>two</code>.
Hint: derive a class from <code>streambuf</code> as well. Call it <code>BiStreamBuffer</code>,
and implement this latter class as well. 
<p>
Hints: both classes are <em>extremely</em> simple: their members have bodies
consisting of at most a few simple expression statements, and can often
defensibly be implemented <em>inline</em>. If you're encountering complexities,
then you're doing something wrong. Also: keep it simple and don't descend too
quickly into stream intestines.
</p><p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
        The class used by the user is:
        </p><pre>#ifndef _INCLUDED_BISTREAM_
#define _INCLUDED_BISTREAM_

#include "../bistreambuffer/bistreambuffer.h"
#include &lt;ostream&gt;

class BiStream: private BiStreamBuffer, public std::ostream
{
    public:
        BiStream(std::ostream &amp;first, std::ostream &amp;second);
};

inline BiStream::BiStream(std::ostream &amp;first, std::ostream &amp;second)
:
    BiStreamBuffer(first, second),
    std::ostream(this)
{}

#endif
</pre>

<p>
Its functionality is derived from its <code>ostream</code> base class. The
actual handling of the output is left to its private <code>BiStreamBuffer</code> class.
</p><p>
The <code>BiStreamBuffer</code> class derives from <code>std::streambuf</code> and
receives the references to the two streams. Since all characters pass through
<code>overflow</code> (using the simplest form of a derived <code>std::streambuf</code>
class), only that member needs to be overridden. It simply passes the received
characters to the <code>ostream</code>'s <code>put</code> members:
        </p><pre>#ifndef _INCLUDED_BISTREAMBUFFER_
#define _INCLUDED_BISTREAMBUFFER_

#include &lt;ostream&gt;
#include &lt;streambuf&gt;

class BiStreamBuffer: public std::streambuf
{
    std::ostream &amp;d_first;
    std::ostream &amp;d_second;

    public:
        BiStreamBuffer(std::ostream &amp;first, std::ostream &amp;second);

    private:
        virtual int overflow(int ch);
};

inline BiStreamBuffer::BiStreamBuffer(std::ostream &amp;first, 
                                      std::ostream &amp;second)
:
    d_first(first),
    d_second(second)
{}

inline int BiStreamBuffer::overflow(int ch)
{
    d_first.put(ch);
    d_second.put(ch);
    return ch;
}

#endif
</pre>

<p>
Following this basic model, additional functionality can be implemented
easily. Some thoughts:
        </p><ul>
        <li> Provide names rather than stream references
        </li><li> Use a container to store any number of streams (then using stream
pointers): <code>BiStream</code> would become <code>MultiStream</code>
        </li><li> Allow seek-operations.
        </li></ul>
<p>
<br><br>
    
</p><p>
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 26.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to design a streambuf reading from file
descriptors. 
<p>
Formally, file descriptors (FDs) are not defined in the context of C++, but
they are available in many operating systems. E.g., when connecting to a
computer in the Internet TCP/IP communication is based on a <em>socket</em> which,
in our computers, is a FD.
</p><p>
In this exercise design the class <code>IFdStreambuf</code>. Objects of this class may
be used as a <code>std::streambuf</code> of std::istream objects to allow extractions
from an (already open) FD.
</p><p>
The class should offer the following facilities:
    </p><ul>
    <li> A mode <code>Mode</code> having values <code>CLOSE_FD</code> and <code>KEEP_FD</code>. When the
        objects is destroyed it should close the FD if its more equals
        <code>CLOSE_FD</code>.
    </li><li> A constructor optionally specifying the oject's Mode (by default:
        <code>KEEP_FD</code>). 
    </li><li> A constructor expecting a file descriptor and optionally a
        Mode (by default <code>KEEP_FD</code>).
    </li><li> A member <code>close</code> closing the FD.
    </li><li> A member <code>open</code> having the same parameters as the second
        constructor, resulting in using the specified FD.
    </li><li> The class does not support promotions.
    </li></ul>
<p>
Notes: no additional constructors and no assignment operators may be
        available. Internally, use a buffer of some fixed size (e.g., 100
        chars). In addition to standard extractions it should also support
        <code>read</code> facilities, for which <code>xsgetn</code> should be overridden: it
        first copies what's available in <code>IFdStreambuf's</code> own buffer and
        will then try to read some more from the FD, adding it to the
        destination buffer. 
</p><p>
Hints: consult the <strong>open</strong>(2) and <strong>close</strong>(2) man-pages.

        <strong>Exercise 27.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to design a streambuf writing to file
descriptors. 
<p>
See the previous exercise for a description of its counterpart:
<code>IFdStreambuf</code>. <code>OFdStreambuf</code> objects can be used as <code>std::streambuf</code>
objects writing information to FDs. 
</p><p>
Constructors should be designed like <code>IFdStreambuf</code> constructors, and the
same <code>open</code> and <code>close</code> members must be offered.  Note that classes
derived from <code>OFdStreambuf</code> can use <code>pubsync</code> to flush <code>OFdStreambuf's</code>
internal buffer.
</p><p>
Hint: the actual flushing should be performed by the (private) 
member <code>sync</code>, which is used by other <code>OFdStreambuf</code> members as well.

        <strong>Exercise 28.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to design streams.
<p>
Design <code>IFdStream</code> and <code>OFdStream</code> which are, respectively <code>istream</code> and
<code>ostream</code> objects reading from and writing to streams. Neither class
supports promotions.
</p><p>
Both classes should <em>only</em> define a constructor expecting a FD.
</p><p>
Standard, the FD 0 is associated with the keyboard. FD 1 with the computer's
screen. Assuming that <code>in</code> is an <code>IFdStream</code> associated with FD 0, and
<code>out</code> is an <code>OFdStream</code> associated with FD 1, show in a <code>main</code> function
how you define such objects and how to copy information entered at the
keyboard to the screen.
</p><p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    Here is <code>IFdStream's</code> header file (= implementation)
</p><p>
</p><pre>#ifndef INCLUDED_IFDSTREAM_
#define INCLUDED_IFDSTREAM_

{
    public:
        explicit IFdStream(int fd);
};

inline IFdStream::IFdStream(int fd)
:
    IFdStreambuf(fd),
    std::istream(this)
{}

#endif
</pre>

<p>

{
    public:

};

        <strong>Exercise 29.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to implement a base class that can be used
when applying the Template Method Design Pattern.
<p>
The <strong>fork</strong>(2) function allows you to start a copy of the current
process (see also the next exercise for an application). 
</p><p>
To summarize <strong>fork</strong>(2): at the <code>fork</code> call a duplicate (a <em>child</em>) of
the current program (the <em>parent</em>) is created, and both programs (parent and
child) continue beyond the <code>fork()</code> system call. Each program (also called a
<em>process</em>) has a <em>process id</em>, and the child's process id is returned by
<code>fork</code> in the parent process, while <code>fork</code> returns 0 in the child's
process. In theory  <code>fork</code> may fail, in which case it returns -1.
</p><p>
Since the above details are invariant over all programs using <code>fork</code>, they
are perfectly suited for encapsulation in an abstract base class, only
requiring the construction of a derived class in which the parent's actions
after <code>fork()</code> and in which the child's actions after <code>fork()</code> must be
implemented.
</p><p>
Design and submit the abstract base class <code>Fork</code> which does not offer copy
and move construction or assignment, and which only has one public member
<code>void fork()</code>. In addition it offers private members <code>void
parentProcess()</code> and <code>void childProcess()</code> which <em>must</em> be implemented by
derived classes, implementing, respectively, the actions performed by the
parent process and the actions implemented by the child process after the
fork. When <code>childProcess()</code> ends the child process must stop. In addition
some protected members must be defined:
    </p><ul>
    <li> <code>pid_t pid() const</code> returns the child's process id in the parent's code
        and 0 in the child's code;
    </li><li> <code>int waitForChild() const</code> This member may be called by parentProcess
        to wait
        for the completion of the child-process. The return value (exit-code)
        of the child process is returned as a value between 0 and 255. If the
        child process terminates before the completion of the parent process,
        then <code>waitForChild</code> should (must) be called to prevent zombies from
        occurring. Alternatively, the parent process may terminate while the
        child process is still alive.  This is the normal way to create a
        daemon process. The implementation of <code>waitForChild</code> is not
        difficult. Since it's not the core topic of this exercise its
        implementation is provided here:
            <pre>
    int Fork::waitForChild() const
    {
        int status;
    
        waitpid(d_pid, &amp;status, 0);
    
        return WEXITSTATUS(status);
    }
            
</pre>

        int waitForChild();                 // returns the status

    private:

};

{
    return d_pid;
}

#endif

{}
</pre>

    <pre>#include "fork.ih"

void Fork::fork()
{
    if ((d_pid = ::fork()) &lt; 0)
        throw "Fork::fork() failed";

    if (d_pid == 0)                 // childprocess has pid == 0
    {
        childProcess();
        throw "Fork::fork(): child process didn't exit";
    }                               // childProcess() should exit

    parentProcess();
}

        <strong>Exercise 30.</strong>
        <br>
        (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: learn to handle input from multiple sources.
<p>
The <code>select</code> system call (see the <strong>select</strong>(2) man-page) allows you to
react to input from different input-FDs. Since input from different FDs may
arrive asynchroneously you cannot wait for input on one FD to arrive, because
that might prevent you from obtaining the information arriving on another FD.
</p><p>
The <code>select</code> system call can be used for other purposes as well: it can do
the same for output FDs and also for (what are called) <em>exception</em> FDs,
which are unrelated to C++'s exceptions, but are primarily used with detecting
`urgent' data in TCP connections (so called out-of-band data). Also,
<code>select</code> can be used to trigger an alarm if no activity on the watched FDs
was observed for a certain amount of time. 
</p><p>
Select is a very useful facility in situations where we need to process
multiple input streams, but also if we want to do things if no input
arrives. The Red Thread's monitor program uses this by setting an alarm for 1
second while waiting for information appearing on the fifo it uses to read
information from the various <code>Connections</code>. 
</p><p>
But <code>select</code> has one drawback: it requires lots of administrative work,
which clobbers the environment in which <code>select</code> is used. Therefore,
encapsulating it in a <code>Select</code> class is an attractive option.
</p><p>
In this exercise, design your class <code>Selector</code>. It should offer a default
constructor, initializing the object with no input file descriptors and no
alarm. Its members are:
        </p><ul>
        <li> <code>void addReadFd(int fd)</code>, adding a filedescriptor to the set of
            file descriptors that are monitored for reading.
        </li><li> <code>void noAlarm()</code>, preventing timeout-alarms from occurring.
        </li><li> <code>int nReady()</code>, returning the number of available file descriptors.
            0 is returned at a timeout, -1: is returned when select(2) itself
            fails.
        </li><li> <code>int readFd()</code>, returning -1 of no more file descriptors are
            available for reading. Otherwise the next available file
            descriptor for reading is returned. Returning from <code>wait</code> (see
            below), this function can be called repeatedly until -1 is
            returned, servicing each available filedescriptor in turn. Note
            that the file whose file descriptor is returned by readFd may also
            be at its end-of-file position.  The file is `ready for readingâ��,
            but no characters will be returned when trying to read from it due
            to its end-of-file status. In that case the file descriptor is
            probably best removed from the set of active file descriptors.
        </li><li> <code>void rmReadFd(int fd)</code> removes a filedescriptor from the set of
            file descriptors that are monitored for reading.
        </li><li> <code>void setAlarm(int sec, int usec = 0)</code>, sets the alarm at the
            indicated seconds and micro-seconds. If no action occurred on one
            of the monitored file descriptions following the indicated amount
            of time, <code>wait</code> returns with <code>nReady</code> returning 0. The
            requested alarm time (sec + usec / 1e+6) may not be negative or an
            exception is thrown.  A 0 alarm time specification results in
            <code>wait</code> returning immediately. To switch off the alarm time use
            <code>noAlarm</code>.
        </li><li> <code>int wait()</code>, called to wait for activities on the installed file
            descriptors or timeout-period.  The members <code>nReady</code> and
            <code>readFd</code> show their defined behaviors only after <code>wait</code> has
            returned.
<p>
It throws an exception when <strong>select</strong>(2) fails, which may very
            well indicate the end of any available input. An exception is also
            thrown if the program received a signal.
</p><p>
If <code>wait</code> returns normally its return value represents the
            number of available file descriptors. Note that <code>wait</code> may also
            return with an input file descriptor returned by readFd of a file
            at its end-of-file position. The file is `ready for readingâ��, but
            no characters will be returned when trying to read from it due to
            its end-of-file status.
        </p></li></ul>
    Illustrate the use of <code>Select</code> in a small program, printing the message
<code>Are you there?</code> every 5 seconds after sensing activities on the standard
input stream. When a line of input was read, then that line should be
displayed, resetting the waiting interval to 5 seconds (hint: this resetting
should not be required by the program, but should be automatically handled by
the <code>Selector</code> object).

        <strong>Exercise 31.</strong>
        <br>
        (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: learn to broaden your view about polymorphism
<p>
This is a weird, and therefore optional exercise.
</p><p>
Construct a base class offering a member <code>Base *clone() const</code>. 
</p><p>
Derive two classes from it: class A and class C. Without using polymorphism
your program should be able to clone A and C objects, as illustrated by the
following program (the program by itself is a piece of shit, as it leaks like
hell, but that's OK for this exercise):
        </p><pre>
    int main()
    {
        Base *base[4] = { new A{}, new C{} };
    
        cout &lt;&lt; "cloning 1\n";
    
        base[2] = base[0]-&gt;clone();
        base[3] = base[1]-&gt;clone();
    
        cout &lt;&lt; "cloning 2\n";
    
        for (auto bp: base)
            bp-&gt;clone();
    }
        
</pre>

<p>
Its output should be:
        </p><pre>
    cloning 1
    clone from A
    clone from C
    cloning 2
    clone from A
    clone from C
    clone from A
    clone from C
        
</pre>

<p>
In addition to submitting the program, answer the question why this
non-polymorphic cloning is ill-advised.
</p><p>
Hint: the base class must know for what kind of class it is the base class,
somewhat comparable to what happens in polymorphism, where you have Vtables.
</p><p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    Here is the program:
    </p><pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

struct Base
{
    Base *(*d_clone)(Base const *);

    Base *clone() const
    {
        return d_clone(this);
    }
};

struct A: public Base
{
    A()
    {
        d_clone = clone;
    }

    static Base *clone(Base const *obj)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "clone from A\n";
        return new A{static_cast&lt;A const &amp;&gt;(*obj)};
    }
};

struct C: public Base
{
    C()
    {
        d_clone = clone;
    }

    static Base *clone(Base const *obj)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "clone from C\n";
        return new C{static_cast&lt;C const &amp;&gt;(*obj)};
    }
};

int main()
{
    Base *base[4] = { new A{}, new C{} };

    cout &lt;&lt; "cloning 1\n";

    base[2] = base[0]-&gt;clone();
    base[3] = base[1]-&gt;clone();

    cout &lt;&lt; "cloning 2\n";

    for (auto bp: base)
        bp-&gt;clone();
}




</pre>

<p>
This design is ill-advised because (main reason) the nature of the objects
cannot be determined from the pointers: e.g., there are no virtual destructors
and simply doing <code>delete base[idx]</code> will therefore result in incomplete
destruction.
