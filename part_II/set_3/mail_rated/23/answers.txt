Briefly describe the steps that must be performed to add another operator 
(like multiplication) to the calculator (i.e., to the class Operations):

To add another operator, for example multiplication
    * define a class multiplication implementing the operator in terms in cast
    to a corresponding Binops member.
    * The binops member calls the real implementation that is found in
    operations.
