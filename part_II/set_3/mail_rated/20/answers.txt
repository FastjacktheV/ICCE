Exercise 20
Describe (short!) how you solve this problem:
Binops is friends with Operations so it can use Operation's functions add and 
sub. So Binops makes the base classes Addition and Subtraction friends, so they
can use Binops functions. Now we only have to create functions within Binops 
which access Operation's add and sub functions.

- There is a fundamental (albeit solvable) problem with this design. What is 
this problem? 
A base class is used to access a derived class functionality. This makes things
very complicated and besides is unnecessary. The good solution is to simply use 
the derived class. After all, the derived class has all the functionality that 
the base class offers and even more.
