        <strong>Exercise 20.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn the implications of using friends.
<p>
When implementing binary operators some of these operators might be
implemented in separate classes. Assume we have a class <code>Addition</code>
implementing the binary addition operations, and a class <code>Subtraction</code>
implementing the binary subtraction operations.
</p><p>
Furthermore, <code>Addition</code> and <code>Subtraction</code> are base classes of a class
<code>Binops</code>. 
</p><p>
A class <code>Operations</code> implements the (private) functions
        </p><pre>
    void add(Operations const &amp;rhs);
    void sub(Operations const &amp;rhs);
        
</pre>

    and inherits from the class <code>Binops</code>. Furthermore, <code>Operations</code>
declares <code>Binops</code> a friend class. 
<p>
Clearly, a member like <code>Addition::operator+=(Operations const &amp;rhs)</code>
must call <code>Operations' add</code> member, but that member is private, and
<code>Operations</code> does not declare <code>Addition</code> as a friend class. 
</p><p>
</p><ul>
    <li> Describe (short!) how you solve this problem
    </li><li> There is a fundamental (albeit solvable) problem with this
        design. What is this problem?
    </li><li> Provide the class interfaces of <code>Binops, Addition</code> and
        <code>Subtraction</code>. 
    </li></ul>
<p>
Note: you are not supposed to modify <code>Operations</code>. You may assume it
offers a default constructor (declared as <code>Operations() = default</code>, and the
abovementioned two members <code>add</code> and <code>sub</code>.
</p><p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    See ex. 23.
</p><p>
Semantic explanation of and thoughts behind these exercises:
</p><p>
By now polymorphism has been covered, and so its concepts can be used
below. 
</p><p>
Had <code>Addition</code> and <code>Subtraction</code> been polymorphic base classes then
they could define virtual members like <code>add</code> and <code>sub</code>, which would then
be overridden (i.e., implemented) by derived classes. This allows us to
concentrate completely on addition in the class <code>Addition</code> and on
subtraction in the class <code>Subtraction</code>.
</p><p>
The classes implementing arithmetic operators, not knowing
whether the eventually derived class actually supports specific operations may 
provide default implementations of their virtual members, throwing, e.g.,
<code>std::logic_error</code> exceptions.
</p><p>
In most situations it's of course nice if both operations are
available. Multiple inheritance is then called for, but it's awkward having to
derive every class from all of these base classes. Here there are only two
base classes defining operations, but of course many more operators are
available.
</p><p>
To avoid having to list all these base classes the class <code>Binops</code> is
defined: it inherits from all available classes implementing binary
operators. 
</p><p>
By deriving a class <code>Operations</code> from <code>Binops</code> all binary operators are
suddenly available, but using them might result in exceptions being thrown: 
we now have a class that in theory is capable of performing any operation we
like. The ones that actually become available are those that fit the semantic
meaning of <code>Operations</code>. Think about basic types: if it represents an
<code>int</code> then all operators are available; if it represents a <code>double</code> then
the bit-wise operators are not available, and using them now automatically
generates an exception, which requires no further action by <code>Operation's</code>
designer. If <code>Operations</code> should support addition, then its <code>add</code> function
should be implemented, and that's all.
</p><p>
Let this sink in, to realize how flexible this design is.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, at this point we cannot yet use polymorphism. So in these
exercises we try to mimic its facilities. That's not easily realized. Here is
how it can be done:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li> First, we need the classes providing the basic operators: e.g.,
    <code>Addition</code> provivdes <code>operator+</code> and <code>operator+=</code>.
<p>
</p></li><li> Those classes cannot call the finally derived classes' members: they have
    no idea what class that is.
<p>
</p></li><li> But we use a similar setup as with the polymorphic approach: we postpone
    solving our problems, and define an intermediate class <code>Binops</code>,
    deferring finding a solution to that class. In line with the private
    nature of virtual members we define private members like <code>addWrap</code> and
    <code>subWrap</code> making the <code>Addition</code> and <code>Subtraction</code> classes its
    friend. 
<p>
</p></li><li> Now the base arithmetic classes can call members like <code>addWrap</code> and
    <code>subWrap</code>. In order to do that, objects of the arithmetic classes
    (which, because of the inheritance are <em>also</em> <code>Binops</code> class objects)
    can call the wrapping functions after statically casting them to
    <code>Binops</code> objects.
<p>
</p></li><li> To add more arithmetic facilities simply define additional arithmetic
    classes, defining the matching arithmetic operators, and calling matching
    <code>...Wrap</code> members of <code>Binops</code>, and declaring those additional classes
    as <code>Binops'</code> friend.
<p>
</p></li><li> The ugly part so far is that although the inheritance tree is strictly
    linear (so far, so good), the implementation tree is more complex: the
    aritmetic operators need to call <code>Binops</code> members, so when implementing
    <code>operator+=</code> it must know about <code>Binops::addWrap</code>: in order to test
    <code>Addition, Binops</code> must (partially) be available. In order to test
    <code>Binops, Operations</code> must (partially) be available. That's a partial
    cyclic dependency which in this case cannot easily be avoided.
<p>
</p></li><li> Finally, the class <code>Operations</code> implements the actual arithmic
    operations. It declares <code>Binops</code> its friend, allowing,
    e.g. <code>Binops::addWrap</code> to call <code>Operations::add</code>. Again, since
    <code>Binops</code> is <code>Operations'</code> friend, <code>Binops::addWrap</code> can call
    <code>Operations::add</code> after casting the <code>Binops</code> object to an
    <code>Operations &amp;</code>.
</li></ul>

        <strong>Exercise 21.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to implement a class hierarchy using friends
in the final derived class.
<p>
(See the previous exercise)
</p><p>
Implement the classes <code>Addition, Subtraction, Binops</code>.
</p><p>
The free binary operators that are associated with the 
classes <code>Addition</code> and <code>Subtraction</code> do not have to be implemented for
this exercise; only the compound assignment operators need to be implented.
</p><p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    See ex. 23.
</p><p>

        <strong>Exercise 22.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to use a class hierarchy using friends
in the final derived class.
<p>
(See the previous two exercises)
</p><p>
Implement the free binary operators of the classes <code>Addition</code> and
<code>Subtraction</code> and implement the <code>add</code> and <code>sub</code> members of
<code>Operations</code>. These members merely have to insert a confirmation into
<code>cout</code> when they are being called (e.g., <code>Operations::add</code> inserts
<code>"addition"</code>.
</p><p>
Submit your implementations and show that a program calling all binary
operators (free and compound) work as intended.
</p><p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    See ex. 23.

        <strong>Exercise 23.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to use a class hierarchy using friends
in the final derived class.
<p>
(See the previous three exercises)
</p><p>
Create a <code>main</code> function which is an interactive basic calculator, showing
that all binary operators (free and compound) work as intended.
</p><p>
Briefly describe the steps that must be performed to add another operator
(like multiplication) to the calculator (i.e., to the class <code>Operations</code>).
</p><p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    Here is the <code>main</code> function, defining and using <code>Operations</code> objects:
        </p><pre>#include "main.ih"

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    Operations o1;
    Operations o2;

    o1 += o2;
    Operations{} += o1;

    Operations o3{o1 + o2};
    Operations o4{Operations{} + o2};

    
}
</pre>

<p>
The class <code>Operation</code> is:
        </p><pre>#ifndef INCLUDED_OPERATIONS_
#define INCLUDED_OPERATIONS_

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include "../binops/binops.h"

class Operations: public Binops
{
    friend Binops;

    private:
        void add(Operations const &amp;rhs);
        void sub(Operations const &amp;rhs);
};
        
inline void Operations::add(Operations const &amp;rhs)
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Addition\n";
}

inline void Operations::sub(Operations const &amp;rhs)
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Subtraction\n";
}

#endif
</pre>

<p>
It derives from <code>Binops</code>. <code>Binops</code> forwards calls of <code>Operations'</code>
members using wrapper functions, which can be called by its friends:
<code>Addition</code> and <code>Subtraction</code>:
</p><p>
</p><pre>#ifndef INCLUDED_BINOPS_
#define INCLUDED_BINOPS_

#include "../addition/addition.h"
#include "../subtraction/subtraction.h"

class Operations;

class Binops: public Addition, public Subtraction
{
    friend Addition;
    friend Subtraction;

    private:
        void addWrap(Operations const &amp;rhs);
        void subWrap(Operations const &amp;rhs);

};
        
#endif
</pre>

<p>
The implementation of <code>addWrap</code> uses the fact that the <code>Binops</code> object,
since it's a base class of <code>Operations</code>, is also an <code>Operations</code>, and so a
static cast can be used:
</p><p>
</p><pre>#include "binops.ih"

void Binops::addWrap(Operations const &amp;rhs)
{
    static_cast&lt;Operations &amp;&gt;(*this).add(rhs);
}

</pre>

<p>
The member <code>addSub</code> is implemented analogously.
</p><p>
The class <code>Addition</code>'s interface merely has to declare the existence of
<code>Operations</code>, and therefore there is no circular class dependency (i.e., not
at the interface level). Here is <code>Addition's</code> interface:
</p><p>
</p><pre>#ifndef INCLUDED_ADDITION_
#define INCLUDED_ADDITION_

class Operations;
class Binops;

class Addition
{
    public:
        Operations &amp;operator+=(Operations const &amp;rhs) &amp;;
        Operations operator+=(Operations const &amp;rhs) &amp;&amp;;    // or return
                                                            // Operations &amp;&amp;

}; 

Operations operator+(Operations const &amp;lhs, Operations const &amp;rhs);
Operations operator+(Operations &amp;&amp;lhs, Operations const &amp;rhs);

#endif
</pre>

<p>
Note that all of functions are declared as functions expecting and returning
<code>Operations</code>. At the interface level that's OK, since here we only need to
know that <code>Operations</code> is an existing type.
</p><p>
As <code>Addition</code> defines <code>operator+=</code>, the implementation of the 
binary operators is standard. But it has to be provided by <code>Addition</code>, since
only in <code>Addition</code> the required <code>operator+=</code> become available. Here are
the familiar free operators:
</p><p>
</p><pre>#include "addition.ih"

Operations operator+(Operations const &amp;lhs, Operations const &amp;rhs)
{
    Operations tmp(lhs);
    tmp += rhs;
    return tmp;
}
</pre>

        <pre>#include "addition.ih"

Operations operator+(Operations &amp;&amp;lhs, Operations const &amp;rhs)
{
    move(lhs) += rhs;
    return move(lhs);
}
</pre>

<p>
Since, because of the used inheritance structure, an <code>Addition</code> is a
<code>Binops</code> is an <code>Operations</code>, an <code>Addition</code> object can statically be cast
to either class. Casting to <code>Operations</code> is required to return the
<code>Addition</code> object from the compund addition functions, casting to <code>Binops</code>
is required to gain access to <code>Binop's addWrap</code> member. Here are the
implementations of the compound addition members:
</p><p>
</p><pre>#include "addition.ih"

Operations &amp;Addition::operator+=(Operations const &amp;rhs) &amp;
{
        // The following is OK, but doesn't help:
    //Operations &amp;op = static_cast&lt;Operations &amp;&gt;(*this);
    //op.add(rhs);  // WC: add is private

    // And therefore, this doesn't work either (same reason)
    //static_cast&lt;Operations &amp;&gt;(*this).add(rhs);

    static_cast&lt;Binops &amp;&gt;(*this).addWrap(rhs);
    return static_cast&lt;Operations &amp;&gt;(*this);
}
        
</pre>

        <pre>#include "addition.ih"

Operations Addition::operator+=(Operations const &amp;rhs) &amp;&amp;
{
    static_cast&lt;Binops &amp;&amp;&gt;(std::move(*this)).addWrap(rhs);
    return std::move(static_cast&lt;Operations &amp;&gt;(*this));
}
      
</pre>

<p>
The class <code>Subtraction</code> is implemented analogously.
</p><p>
<br><br>
    
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 24.</strong>
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to initialize <code>string</code> objects with <code>new</code>
(<code>std::string</code> is used in this example, but other classes could also be used
in analogous implementations.
<p>
Objects of the class <code>string</code> can be initialized in various ways.  Implement
a function <code>string *factory(string const &amp;str, size_t count)</code> returning the
result of a new-expression in which <code>`count' string</code> objects are allocated,
and which were at construction time initialized with <code>str</code>.
</p><p>
Caveat: the initialization <em>must</em> be performed at the <code>new</code> expression, so
allocate first, followed by e.g., copy assignments or placement new actions
should not be used.
</p><p>
<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    In this case, use the fact that a class that inherits from a base class is
also a base class object. The <code>factory</code> function therefore defines a nested
<code>struct Inner</code>, derived from <code>std::string</code>. Its default constructor
initializes its base class with an available (static) string that received the
factory's 1st argument as its value, just before returning.
</p><p>
Note: implementations that use static data that are modified by functions
require minor modifications in multi-threaded programs where different threads
may synchroneously call those functions. We'll postpone solving that subtlety
until we reach the final topics of this part of the course.
</p><p>
Here's the implementation:
    </p><pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

using namespace std;

string *factory(string const &amp;iniText, size_t count)
{
//    static string const &amp;name = filename;     // won't work: static 
//    static string const *name = &amp;filename;    // initializations are
                                                // performed only once.

    static string const *name;                  // Note that the name cannot
    name = &amp;iniText;                            // be initialized (happens
                                                // only once). Instead, a 
                                                // explicit assignment by
                                                // factory is required 

    struct Inner: public string                 // a support struct, uses 
    {                                           //  'name'
        Inner()
        :
            string(*name)
        {}
    };

    return new Inner[count];
}

int main()
{
    string *sp = factory("hello world", 10);

    cout &lt;&lt; sp[0] &lt;&lt; ", " &lt;&lt; sp[4] &lt;&lt; ", " &lt;&lt; sp[9] &lt;&lt; '\n';

    delete[] sp;

    sp = factory("Something else", 12);

    cout &lt;&lt; sp[0] &lt;&lt; ", " &lt;&lt; sp[4] &lt;&lt; ", " &lt;&lt; sp[9] &lt;&lt; '\n';

    delete[] sp;
}
