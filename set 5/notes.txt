Pointers vs Arrays
    Arrays always have the same adressses
    Pointers can change
    Therefore: can assign array to pointer; but not pointer to array
    "name of array is const pointer to first element"
[] is dereferencing operator, just like *
    they dereference what they follow
    a[5] = 0; is the same as *(a+5) = 0; 
        both deref the 5th element of the array
        both are valid for array and pointer a!

Pointer arithmatic
    only add & sub
    pointer arithm respects the type to which one points
    so ++ptr will be increase the adress of the pointer by the size in bytes of the type it points to!







General notes
    postfix operators have higher precendence than prefix operators.
