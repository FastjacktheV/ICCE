1. Differences pointers and arrays
    While the addresses to which a pointer points can be changed, an array will,
    after creation, always be represented by the same block of adresses in memory. 
    This memory is reserved for the array. 
    A pointer does not reserve the memory to which it points. 


2. Differences between pointers and references
    References have to be initialized during decleration and are constant
    thereafter, whereas pointers can be declared without initialization and may be
    changed to point somewhere else after initialization. Pointers can point
    nowhere, references always point somewhere.
    Pointers have to be dereferenced explicitely, whereas references are
    implicitely dereferenced. 
    References can be bound to anonymous values, whereas pointers can not.

4. Pointer Arithmetic   
    Incrementing a pointer increases its adress by a value equal
    to the size of the pointer type. This increment ++ptr can be also be written
    ptr = ptr + 1. In the same way we can write ptr = ptr + 3 to move three of 
    <typesize of ptr> to the right. Substraction is defined analogously. 

5. Iterating using pointers
