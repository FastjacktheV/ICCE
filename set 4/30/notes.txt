outside world: cin
instruction on single line (lowercase versions of the Opcode)


Tokenizer class
    opcode (converts first element to oppcode, returns it)
    Then : request more info (operands
    OperandType token() retrieves next operand type
    int value;          returns operands type value
    reset()
        check if reading from cin still possible
        clear()
        read rest of line
        

    If an instruction like mov @1000 z is entered, then the Tokenizer should dutifully return Opcode::MOV, OperandType::MEMORY (value 1000), OperandType::REGISTER (value 25). 


Questions
    where does reading take place
    how much reading at once (CPU keeps calling opcodes)
        one read.
    what is set? depends on instruction
