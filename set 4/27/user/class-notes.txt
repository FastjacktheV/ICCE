* in cpp, structs are used mostly as data agr
* member functions are declared in class def
* member funcs are defined elsewhere
* member funcs are manipulators & accessors
* manipulators start with set
* get prefix for accessors is deprecated

Constructor
* name equal to class name
* returns nothing
* default constructor exists
* constructor is called when object defined (instance)
* static objects constructed at program start (called before main)
* constructors ensure that class data has sensible (well-defined)
values after object construction
* to prevent backdoors, return objects as const references
(not just the ref const, but ref to const)

Ambiguity
    Data d1();
    Data d2(argc);
