            <strong>Exercise 16.</strong>
            <br>
            Purpose of this exercise: learn to compare types of template parameters.
<p>
Design a (meta) class template <code>Type</code> whose template type arguments consist
of a series of types (at least one). The first type is the `needle' type,
which must be located in the remaining `haystack' types. The template's value
'located' must have the value <code>0</code> if the first type is not encountered in
the remaining types and must be equal to the index of the first occurrence of
`needle' (beyond `needle' itself) in the template's template argument types
(so the first type in the `haystack' types has index value 1).
</p><p>
A program using <code>Type</code> could be:
    </p><pre>
    int main()
    {
        cout &lt;&lt;
            Type&lt;int&gt;::located &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt; 
            Type&lt;int, double&gt;::located &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt; 
            Type&lt;int, int&gt;::located &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt; 
            Type&lt;int, double, int&gt;::located &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt; 
            Type&lt;int, double, int&gt;::located &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt; 
            Type&lt;int, double, int, int, int&gt;::located &lt;&lt; 
            '\n';
    }
        
</pre>

<p>
This program must display:
        </p><pre>
    0 0 1 2 2 2
        
</pre>

<p>
Submit your implementation of the class template <code>Type</code> and show that it
could be compiled producing the expected output when used in the
abovementioned <code>main</code> function.
</p><p>
Hint: use a support meta class template <code>TypeIdx</code> to compute the required
index value.
</p><p>
Caveat: your class(es) may <em>not</em> define any (static) variables.
</p><p>
<br><br>
</p><p>
              
       
        
            </p><hr>
            <strong>Exercise 17.</strong>
            <br>
            (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: learn to compare types of template parameters (part
II).
<p>
This exercise may earn you two points.
</p><p>
It's the same exercise as the previous exercise, but in the previous exercise
you most likely used a separate class to do the index computations.
</p><p>
In this exercise the support class <em>must</em> be a private, nested class (the
support class may be a <code>struct</code>) of the class <code>Type</code>.
</p><p>
Submit your implementation of the class template <code>Type</code> and show that it
could be compiled producing the expected output when used in the
<code>main</code> function shown in the previous exercise.
</p><p>
You earn one point if your implementation meets the requirements of this
exercise, and two points if the template parameter lists used for the nested
<code>TypeIdx</code> class are as short as possible.
</p><p>
<br><br>
</p><p>
              
       
        
            </p><hr>
            <strong>Exercise 18.</strong>
            <br>
            Purpose: learn to design a small template  meta program.
<p>
Design a template meta program displaying a <code>size_t</code> constant (like 12, 210
and 33) as a binary value.
</p><p>
E.g., the following program should display <code>101</code> and on a second line
<code>11011</code>:
        </p><pre>
    int main()
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; Bin&lt;5&gt;::value  &lt;&lt; '\n' &lt;&lt;
                Bin&lt;27&gt;::value &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
        
</pre>

<p>
Your solution should not use divisions and modulo computations.
</p><p>
<br><br>
</p><p>
              
       
        
            </p><hr>
            <strong>Exercise 19.</strong>
            <br>
            Purpose of this exercise: learn to used nested class templates using meta
programming.
<p>
How to display an integral numeric constant  in any radix between 2 and 36?
That is the topic of this exercise. The following program shows how this can
be realized using the <code>Convert</code> class template:
</p><p>
</p><pre>
    int main()
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; Convert&lt;57005, 8&gt;::CP{} &lt;&lt; '\n';    // displays '157255'
        cout &lt;&lt; Convert&lt;57005, 16&gt;::CP{} &lt;&lt; '\n';   // displays 'dead'
        cout &lt;&lt; Convert&lt;57005, 32&gt;::CP{} &lt;&lt; '\n';   // displays '1nld'
    }
        
</pre>

    The first argument is the integral constant  to convert, the second
argument the radix to use.
<p>
A nice feature of <code>Convert</code> is that it uses <code>Chars</code> to store the
characters, so the width of the destination variable (as with the binary
number convertor) is irrelevant.
</p><p>
Design <code>Convert</code> so that it performs the proper conversions, as
illustrated by the example program.
</p><p>
Hints:
    </p><ul>
    <li> Forward <code>Convert</code>'s arguments to <code>Display</code> which takes an
additional non-type parameter, initially <code>false</code>, otherwise <code>true</code>
indicating whether something has been printed at all. Realize that a
specialization stopping the display as soon as the remainder of the division
<code>value / radix</code> reaches zero would prevent <code>Convert&lt;0, 10&gt;</code> from producing
any value. A <code>bool displayed</code> non-type parameter can be used to enforce the
conversion of 0 to <code>'0'</code> in that case.
    </li><li> The non-specialized definition of <code>Display</code> uses template meta
programming recursion, <code>Merge</code>, and <code>OneChar</code> to break-down the first
argument into digits.
    </li></ul>
<p>
Submit the definitions of <code>Convert</code> and <code>Display</code>.
</p><p>
<br><br>
</p><p>
              
       
        
            </p><hr>
            <strong>Exercise 20.</strong>
            <br>
            Purpose of this exercise: learn to extend existing classes with new
facilities, implementing the extensions only once.
<p>
Classes can overload binary operators. A class named <code>Class</code> may
overload these binary operators to suit its own needs, allowing, e.g., two
<code>Class</code> type objects to be added after overloading <code>operator+</code>. Similar
overloads can be used for other binary operators.
</p><p>
If a class supports copy and/or move construction and if it offers a swap
member, then binary operators can all be implemented identically, except for
the specific details associated with specific binary operators. E.g., if a
class contains two <code>int</code> data members addition of objects of that class
could simply be defined as adding the corresponding <code>int</code> members, while
subtraction could be defined as subtracting the corresponding <code>int</code>
members. Assuming the existence of a member <code>void Class::add(Class const
&amp;rhs)</code> that defines the addition of a <code>Class rhs</code> object to the <code>*this</code>
object, while merely providing the basic exception guarantee (i.e., no
leakage), then the binary addition operators can be defined like this:
        </p><pre>
Class operator+(Class &amp;&amp;lhs, Class const &amp;rhs)
{
    lhs.add(rhs);
    return std::move(lhs);
}

Class operator+(Class const &amp;lhs, Class const &amp;rhs)
{
    Class tmp(lhs);
    tmp.add(rhs);
    return tmp;
}
        
</pre>

    Likewise, <code>operator+=</code> can be defined for lvalue or rvalue <code>Class</code>
objects using reference modifiers.
<p>
As binary operators can all be implemented alike, given the specific
members implementing the implied operations, these operators can very well be
provided using templates. 
</p><p>
By inheriting from the class template <code>BinopsBase</code> classes offering such
specific functions can then automatically also offers the matching binary
operators after including <code>binopsbase</code>, containing <code>BinopsBase's</code>
definition. Since the binary function templates are not instantiated until
used their definitions can be processed by the compiler even if a class
implements only a subset of the available binary assignment operators.
</p><p>
In this set of exercises, to provide a class <code>Class</code> with binary (compound)
operators, it must implement a member <code>void swap(Class &amp;other)</code>, and 
the following members (in the class's private section):
    </p><ul>
    <li> <code>void mul(Class const &amp;rhs)</code>  - to provide operators <code>*</code> and <code>*=</code>
    </li><li> <code>void add(Class const &amp;rhs)</code>  - to provide operators <code>+</code> and <code>+=</code>
    </li></ul>
    (once we're able to do this, then the remaining binary operators (like /,
^, &lt;&lt;) etc. can of course be implemented analogously.)
<p>
The binary operators themselves are <em>not</em> implemented in <code>Class</code>, but are
generically implemented in a class template 
        </p><pre>
    template &lt;typename Derived&gt;
    BinopsBase&lt;Derived, int ...operators&gt;
        
</pre>

    where <code>int ...operators</code> lists the specific set of binary operators that
are requested for <code>Class</code>. E.g., to provide <code>Class</code> with multiplication,
and addition its class interface should start like this:
        <pre>
    class Class: public BinopsBase&lt;Class, '*', '+'&gt;
        
</pre>

    but if only addition should be overloaded <code>Class</code> would start like this:
        <pre>
    class Class: public BinopsBase&lt;Class, '+'&gt;
        
</pre>

<p>
If, as advised, the members implementing the required binary operations
(i.e., <code>add, mul</code>) are declared in the class's private section then the
class's interface should declare its base class as a friend. 
        </p><pre>
    class Class: public BinopsBase&lt;Class, '*', '+'&gt;
    {
        friend BinopsBase&lt;Class, '*', '+'&gt;;

        public:
            ...

        private:
            void mul(Class const &amp;rhs);
            void add(Class const &amp;rhs);
    };
        
</pre>

<p>
In this exercise define two classes <code>Adder</code> and <code>Arithmetic</code>. <code>Adder</code>
has a <code>std::string</code> member and <code>Arithmetic</code> is a class template specifying
the data type of the internally used data, which may either be <code>int</code> or
<code>double</code>. Specifying any other type should result in a compilation
error. The classes also have a member <code>value() const</code> returning the value of
their objects' data member, as well as an <code>operator=</code> allowing you to assign
a new value to their <code>d_data</code> data member. E.g., the skeleton of the class
<code>Adder</code> looks something like this:
        </p><pre>
    class Adder: public BinopsBase&lt;Adder, '+'&gt;
    {
        friend class BinopsBase&lt;Adder, '+'&gt;;

        std::string d_value;

        public:
            Adder &amp;operator=(std::string const &amp;rhs);
            std::string const &amp;value() const;
        private:
            void add(Adder const &amp;rhs);
    };
        
</pre>

<p>
Define and implement the class <code>Arithmetic</code> and implement <code>Adder::add</code>.
</p><p>
If you're <em>not</em> going to complete the next two exercises then also provide
an initial implementation (and interface) of the class <code>BinopsBase</code>. 
</p><p>
This class template defines a class type parameter <code>Derived</code>, which will,
when instantiated, be the name of its derived class. It also has a variadic
series of (int) values, instantiated with the series of operator
characters. 
</p><p>
It must declare (not implement) the binary operators (here: only <code>operator+</code>
and <code>operator*</code>), expecting <code>Derived</code> arguments and returning <code>Derived</code>
objects as friends (implementations not required). 
</p><p>
It must also declare and define <code>void addWrap</code> and <code>void mulWrap</code>,
defining <code>Derived const &amp;</code> parameters and calling, respectively,
<code>Derived::add</code> and <code>Derived::mul</code>.
</p><p>
If you're completing the next exercise, then <code>BinopsBase</code> doesn't have to be
implemented here, but it will be implemented in the next exercise.
</p><p>
Note: in a real-life implementation all binary operators would be made
available in <code>BinopsBase</code>. Although declared, only the ones that are
actually used would be implemented. This allows us to create a class covering
all binary operators, implementing them only once, so that the class
<code>BinopsBase</code> can be used thereafter with any class which should offer binary
operators. 
</p><p>
Remember that the binary operators are fee functions, where one overload
defines a first parameter which is a <code>Type const &amp;lhs</code> and another overload
defines a first parameter which is a <code>Type &amp;&amp;lhs</code>.
</p><p>
<br><br>
</p><p>
              
       
        
            </p><hr>
            <strong>Exercise 21.</strong>
            <br>
            Purpose of this exercise: implement a generic class template that uses a
variadic set of <code>int</code> arguments.
<p>
The class <code>BinopsBase</code> introduced in the previous exercise delegates its
actual arithmetic operations to support classes <code>Add</code> and <code>Mul</code>.
</p><p>
Since <code>BinopsBase</code> receives a variadic series of requested operators (e.g.,
<code>'+'</code>, or <code>'*'</code>, or <code>'+', '*'</code> or <code>'*', '+'</code>), <code>BinopsBase</code> itself
cannot handle a specific operation. But it can lay the foundation for handling
these operations. The foundation consists of delegating performing the
actual operations to its own base class: a class <code>BinopsBase0</code> having three
template parameters: the <code>BinopsBase</code> type, <code>BinopBase's Derived</code> class
type, and the variadic operators. 
</p><p>
The class <code>BinopsBase</code> itself has no public members, but declares (see the
previous exercise) the binary operators as its friends.
</p><p>
In addition, it declares the classes <code>Add</code> and <code>Mul</code> as its friends. These
classes are implemented in the next exercise (in an implementation offering
all binary operators there will also be clases <code>Div, Shl, Sub</code>, etc, but
here we restrict ourselves to <code>Add</code> and <code>Mul</code>). Those classes are class
templates having two template type arguments: the <code>BinopsBase</code> and its
derived class type. 
</p><p>
<code>BinopsBase0's</code> generic implementation is not used, but is only
declared. Its terminating implementation (no more operators) is empty.
</p><p>
Implement the class <code>BinopsBase</code>, declaring the classes <code>Add</code> and <code>Mul</code>
as its friends.
</p><p>
<br><br>
</p><p>
              
       
        
            </p><hr>
            <strong>Exercise 22.</strong>
            <br>
            (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: learn to complete a generic class template 
that uses a variadic set of <code>int</code> arguments, by implementing required
support classes. 
<p>
The class template <code>Add</code> (see the previous two exercises) is a class
template having one template type parameter: <code>BinopsBase's Derived</code> class
type. It merely declares the binary compound addition operators. They are
implementated using <code>BinopsBase's addWrap</code> member. They can do so, because
<code>BinopsBase</code> declares <code>Add</code> its friend, and <code>addWrap</code> may call
<code>Derived::add</code>, because the derived class declared <code>BinopsBase</code> as its
friend, allowing it to call the derived class's private members. At this point
the binary addition operators can also be implemented. These latter functions
could have been implemented elsewhere (e.g., when developing <code>BinopsBase</code>),
but by implementing it at this point all addition operators are physically
close together. Not a logically compelling argument, but (hopefully)
aesthetically appealing. 
</p><p>
The really interesting part of the implementation consists of the
implementation of the <code>BinopsBase0</code> partial specialization. The
specialization for add is simply derived from the <code>Add</code> class, and it's used
when the first operator passed to <code>BinopsBase0</code> equals <code>'+'</code>. All
remaining operators are passed to another base class, which itself is a
<code>BinopsBase0</code> class.
</p><p>
Implement <code>Add, Mul</code>, as well as the corresponding binary and binary
compound operators, and the corresponding <code>BinopsBase</code> partial
specializations.
</p><p>
<br><br>
</p><p>
              
       
        
            </p><hr>
            <strong>Exercise 23.</strong>
            <br>
            (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: show that you can use the <code>BinopsBase</code> class
developed in the previous exercises.
<p>
You earn 2 points whenn successfully completing this exercise.
</p><p>
Augment <code>BinopsBase</code> so that it also can support subtraction, and illustrate
its facilities by implementing binary addition, subtraction and multiplication
binary operators and binary compound operators for the class <code>Arithmetic</code>. 
</p><p>
Submit all modified sources (wrt ex. 13, 14 and 15), as well as the
implementation of <code>Sub</code>, handling subtraction, and a small demo program and
its output showing that addition, multiplication and subtraction can be used
for both named and anonymous <code>Arithmetic</code> objects.
