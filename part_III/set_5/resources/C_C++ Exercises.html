<h1>Chapter 5: Exercises set five: Lexical Scanners (Deadline: Mar 22).</h1>
<p>
In this
    set of exercises, several scanners/tokenizers should be constructed. Never
    `roll your own', but always use <code>flexc++</code> to generate your
    scanner from a lexer-specification.
</p><p>
For those who do not have the <strong>flex</strong>(1) documentation available (at
    points this documentation is still useful), it can
    be found <a href="https://www.icce.rug.nl/edu/3/flex-doc/">here</a>. Much of this
    can also be used for <code>flexc++</code>; more information about <code>flexc++</code> can
    be found at <a href="https://fbb-git.github.io/flexcpp/">https://fbb-git.github.io/flexcpp/</a>.
</p><p>
Where applicable, provide at least the flex specification file and the
    <code>scanner.h</code> header file.
</p><p>
Implementations can often be very simple if generic algorithms and/or
    abstract containers are used. Use these facilities where possible, to
    prevent <code>TC</code>-marks.
</p><p>
If you don't want to or can't install <strong>flexc++</strong>(1), then you have the
option to send an e-mail to <code>flexc++@icce.rug.nl</code>. The subject of the
message is irrelevant, the contents must be:
    </p><pre>
FLEXC++ INPUT
the contents of your lexer-specification file 
FLEXC++ INPUT
    
</pre>

    In the return mail you receive a .zip file containing the files generated
by <strong>flexc++</strong>(1) from your specification file. Realize that this is just an
escape route, which may no longer be available after this course. If at all
possible, install your own <strong>flexc++</strong>(1) program.

            <strong>Exercise 31.</strong>
            <br>
            Purpose: learn to recognize embedded patterns
<p>
Construct a program that prints a sorted list of all (different) words
found in a piece of text. This time a word is defined as any consecutive
series of <em>letters</em>, not just a sequence obtained using <code>ostream</code>'s
string-extraction.
</p><p>
The program must be able to read its information from the standard input,
unless command line arguments were provided. In the latter case these
arguments are considered file names and the program should process all these
files.
</p><p>
<br><br>
</p><p>
              
       
        
            </p><hr>
            <strong>Exercise 32.</strong>
            <br>
            Purpose: learn to perform a non-greedy match
<p>
The flex scanner performs <em>greedy</em> matches. Programs like Perl also
offer facilities to perform minimal matches. Why is a minimal match feature
not required for flex? 
</p><p>
Hint: don't make life hard on yourself: don't reinvent the wheel, but (this
time) read the <em>flex</em> manual (there's no specific information about this in
<code>flexc++'s</code> manual. This week's slides may also provide an answer.
</p><p>
Provide a small scanner specification file showing how you could match, e.g.,
<code>house</code> <em>if</em> it is part of the word <code>houseboat</code> or <em>household</em> but
matching all other words (either or not starting with the word house, e.g.,
<code>brick-house, houseboats, housebreaking, houses, house's</code> or any other word)
as individual, unit words.
</p><p>
The `houseboat' and `household' words should be recognized as -first- `house'
and -then- the trailer, be it `boat' or `hold'.
</p><p>
All matched words should be written to the standard output stream.
</p><p>
Words are defined as any consecutive series of non-blank characters.
</p><p>
Your main function should look like this:
</p><p>
</p><pre>#include "main.ih"

int main()
try
{
    Scanner scanner;

    while (scanner.lex())
        ;
}
catch (...)
{
    return 1;
}
</pre>

<p>
<br><br>
</p><p>
              
       
        
            </p><hr>
            <strong>Exercise 33.</strong>
            <br>
            Purpose: construct a scanner using mini-scanners
<p>
Construct a scanner producing `trimmed lines'. A `trimmed line' is any
non-blank line, from which al initial <em>and</em> trailing blanks were
removed. 
</p><p>
Comment (end-of-line and standard <strong>C</strong> comment between
<code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> as well as any text on lines starting at the hash-mark
(<code>#</code>) up to the line's end should be considered blank, unless occurring in
strings (defined as a <strong>C</strong>-string constant, like <code>"hello /* no comment */
world"</code>). 
</p><p>
A standard <strong>C</strong> style comment within a line is simply removed, and if
preceded <em>and</em> followed by a blank one of these blanks should be
dropped. E.g., <code>hello /* comment */ world</code> must result in <code>hello world</code>.
</p><p>
Multi-line comment extending over multiple lines
should result in one single line-break. So, text like:
        </p><pre>
    This is a line /* containing
        multi line
    comment */ and this is more
        
</pre>

    should produce the following two lines (using quotes to indicate the
begining, and end of the lines, they should not be part of the lines your
program produces):
        <pre>
    "This is a line"
    "and this is more"
        
</pre>

    Two lines, because: 
        <pre>
    This is a line /* containing
        multi line
    comment */
        
</pre>

    results in one single line, terminated in a newline. Following this
the next line continues on a line of its own. All other line delimiters
(e.g., line delimiters of empty lines) should be kept. 
<p>
<br><br>
</p><p>
              
       
        
            </p><hr>
            <strong>Exercise 34.</strong>
            <br>
            Purpose: learn to design a scanner scanning a piece of text
<p>
Consider a program (a basic string-grabber) scanning a <strong>C</strong> or <strong>C++</strong> source
file, replacing all strings by calls to a function <code>grabbed(&lt;number&gt;,
&lt;filename&gt;)</code> where <code>&lt;number&gt;</code> is the sequence number (1, 2, ...) of the
grabbed string and <code>&lt;filename&gt;</code> is the name of the file containing the
strings, each line holding one string (matching the <code>&lt;number&gt;</code>s used with
<code>grabbed</code>. The filename should be the name of the source file, using
extension <code>gsl</code> (grabbed string lines).
</p><p>
Strings in comment must be ignored, string concatenation should be supported,
supporting raw string literals is not required: if you also want your
string-grabber to recognize raw string literals, consider completing ex. 36.
When submitting ex. 36 the current exercise (34) does not
have to be submitted: if 36's rating will then also be applied to 34.
</p><p>
Develop the scanner for this program, submit the class interface and the
scanner specification file.
</p><p>
Additional explanation: Assume you have a file which is a C/C++ source
file. The program reads the source, and changes the source so that all strings
(outside of comment) are replaced by a function call.
</p><p>
E.g., assume the filename is '<code>main.cc</code>', containing a stmnt like:
        </p><pre>
    cout &lt;&lt; "hello world";
        
</pre>

Then, following the command
        <pre>
    grab main.cc
        
</pre>

the above stmnt has become:
        <pre>
    cout &lt;&lt; grabbed(1, "main.gsl");
        
</pre>

Likewise, if the next statement is:
        <pre>
    cout &lt;&lt; "This is a long text\n"
            "Displayed over multiple lines\n"
            "But stored in one (concatenated) string\n";
        
</pre>

then this statement becomes:
        <pre>
    cout &lt;&lt; grabbed(2, "main.gsl");
        
</pre>

Furthermore, the exercise asks you to:
<p>
</p><blockquote>
    Develop the scanner for this program, submit the class interface and the
    scanner specification file.
    </blockquote>
<p>
So: scanner.h and lexer should be submitted. Consider adding a brief
    explanation of what the scanner does.
</p><p>
Subtlety:
</p><p>
It's clear that the program modifies an existing file. Although this exercise
    doesn't ask you to implement the scanner's members, there are things to
    consider here:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
    <li> In-file replacement is out of the question. It's too difficult
       because of different lengths of strings and '<code>grabbed(...)</code>' function
       calls
<p>
</p></li><li> So a temporary file is your best option, renaming the temp. filename
       to the original file when done.
<p>
</p></li><li> Using a temp. file isn't trivial. The easy solution is to add some
       extension to the original filename (e.g., '<code>main.cc.tmp</code>'), but such
       a filename might already exist, so you run the risk of inadvertently
       rewriting the existing file
<p>
</p></li><li> However, <strong>mkstemp</strong>(3) creates a file and its tmp name for you. It
       returns a file descriptor, which can immediately be closed after the
       call (e.g., <code>close(mkstemp(tmpName))</code>). Now you have your temporary
       filename in <code>tmpName</code> and it can be opened by ofstream, receiving the
       modified source text.
<p>
</p></li><li> But now you experience a potential problem of changed access rights:
       <code>mkstemp</code> opens the file rw for only the user, but the original file
       may be world-readable. Solve this by:
        <ul>
        <li> using <strong>stat</strong>(2) to obtain the access rights of the original
           file 
        </li><li> using <strong>chmod</strong>(2) to set the access rights of the new file to
           the original file's access rights.
        </li></ul>
    </li></ul>
<p>
Do you think this is a complication that goes well beyond the purpose of the
    exercise? You're probably right, so using the '<code>main.cc.tmp</code>' approach
   is fine for  now.
</p><p>
But a better approach is to encapsulate all this in a small class that
    simply returns a temporary stream for you, and on request renames it to
    another name with appropriate access rights.
</p><p>

            </p><hr>
            <strong>Exercise 35.</strong>
            <br>
            tPurpose of this exercise: design a small tokenizer
<p>
Design a scanner which line-wise tokenizes its (textual) input. Its output
consists of a list of token values followed by the actual text that resulted
in the matched tokens. When single characters are matched, their token values
should be equal to the characters' ASCII value.
</p><p>
The scanner should detect:
    </p><ul>
    <li> words (defined as <strong>C++</strong> identifiers)
    </li><li> integral numbers (as <strong>C++</strong> <code>int</code> constants)
    </li><li> real numbers (as <strong>C++</strong> <code>double</code> constants)
    </li><li> all <strong>C++</strong> operators. Formally there are also words used as
        operators: <code>and, or, sizeof, new, delete,</code> etc. Named operators may
        be considered words.
    </li><li> <strong>C++</strong> strings (string concatenation on one line results in one
string token, strings separated by white space and at least one line delimiter
are considered as separate strings).
    </li><li> <strong>C++</strong> character constants
    </li></ul>
<p>
Blanks should be ignored, and a newline should be returned after all tokens on
a line have been processed.
</p><p>
The scanner does not have to be an interactive scanner.
</p><p>

            <strong>Exercise 36.</strong>
            <br>
            (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: learn to design a scanner scanning a piece of text
(part II) 
<p>
Same exercise as ex. 34, but this string grabber must also recognize raw
string literals (if you submit this exercise, then you do not
have to submit 34. In that case this exercise's rating will also be applied to
34. 
</p><p>
<br><br>
</p><p>
              
       
        
            </p><hr>
            <strong>Exercise 37.</strong>
            <br>
            (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: learn to handle <code>#include</code> directives.
<p>
Write a program (using a <strong>flexc++</strong>(1) based scanner class that copies a file
to the standard output stream. The file to copy may contain
    </p><pre>
    #include "pathname"
    
</pre>

directives on separate lines. In addition to the <code>#include</code> directive the
lines may contain white space and/or comment. 
<p>
The file specified at <code>pathname</code> (which may be a relative path) is written
to the standard output stream at exactly the location of the <code>#include</code>
statement. So, anything on the line preceding the <code>#include</code>
directive must precede the contents of <code>pathname</code>, and after <code>pathname</code>
has been included any additional characters beyond the <code>#include</code> directive
follow. 
</p><p>
The program must stop with an error message if a file to include doesn't
exist, or if (direct or indirect, irrespective of the nesting depth) recursive
includes are encountered.
