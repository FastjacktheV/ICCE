            <strong>Exercise 1.</strong>
            <br>
            Purpose of this exercise: learn to convert an existing class to a class
template. 
<p>
Take your pick: 
    </p><ul>
    <li>
        In part I the class <code>Matrix</code> was introduced (cf. part I's exercises
62, 67-70). Convert the class <code>Matrix</code> to a class template, where the
eventual data type is specified as a template type parameter, but matrices of
operands can be matrices of different data types. E.g., if <code>Matrix&lt;double&gt;
lhs</code> and <code>Matrix&lt;int&gt; rhs</code> are available, then <code>lhs += rhs</code> must be
allowed. With plain binary arithmetic operators (e.g. <code>lhs + rhs</code>),
<code>lhs's</code> type determines the type of the resulting matrix.
<p>
You don't have to construct a full class. Your class should offer:
        </p><ul>
        <li> Standard constructors, overloaded assignment operators and
            destructor; 
        </li><li> Standard insertion and extraction operators;
        </li><li> Addition and compound addition operators;
        </li><li> (In)equality operators
        </li><li> Index operators (as usual: 
                available for const and non-const objects).
        </li></ul>
<p>
</p></li><li>
C++ offers in its standard library ordered and hashing-based associative
containers (resp. <code>map</code> and <code>unordered_map</code>). Great tools, but in some
situations overkill. Sorting is usually only required when your program
prepares a human-readable output, and hashing has the overhead of computing
hash values for keys.
<p>
An associative container <em>not</em> using sorting, and <em>not</em> using hashing but
merely adding elements on a `first come, first serve' basis is a very useful
and fast tool if the size of your data base is not so big that hashing becomes
attractive, and if sorting isn't required. 
</p><p>
Design a class <code>LinearMap</code> that offers the same interface and semantics as
<code>map</code> and <code>unordered_map</code> as described in the <strong>C++</strong> Annotations, but
adds elements on a first-come first-serve (i.e., not ordered at all) basis.
</p><p>
Hint: Build your LinearMap using an existing container, making sure that you
do not have to implement members that are already proviced by your existing
container type, without making its full interface available.
    </p></li></ul>
<p>

            </p><hr>
            <strong>Exercise 2.</strong>
            <br>
            Purpose of this exercise: learn to design a member template
<p>
In part II the class Semaphore was extensively used (see the Annotations for
details). In one of the exercises a <code>wait</code> member accepting a function had
to be developed. In that exercise it was stated:
</p><p>
</p><p></p><hr><p>
</p><p>
A Semaphore's <code>wait</code> member returns once its internal counter is unequal to
zero and the process using the Semaphore are obtained the Semaphore's lock.
</p><p>
Consider a Producer-Client paradigm. If the producer produces the names of
source files to compile, then the program might want to stop once a
compilation fails and the compiler returns errors, even though not all files
to compile have been processed. The clients could share a variable <code>bool
Client::s_continue</code>, and a static member <code>Client::stop()</code> could be used to
set <code>s_continue</code> to false. Once a compilation returns errors, that client
could set <code>s_continue</code> to false, show the error messages and inform the
other clients that they can stop working. The other clients might still be
busy doing their own work but once done, and <code>s_continue</code> is false, their
function implementing the actions of their thread could simply return. But
what happens in situations where clients are waiting for input? When input
arrives slowly, then the clients may have to wait for a fairly long time
before they notice that they should stop.
</p><p>
Alternatively, we can modify the <code>Semaphore::wait</code> member: by providing it
with a function, function object, or lambda function argument, which receives
the <code>Semaphore's</code> counter as a reference, the function that is passed to the
<code>wait</code> member can be given access to <code>s_continue</code> and if <code>s_continue</code> is
false it could, e.g., throw an exception, thus ending the <code>Client's</code> thread
function.
</p><p>
</p><p></p><hr><p>
</p><p>
Assuming a class <code>Semaphore</code> is available, defining these data memebrs:
        </p><pre>
    mutable std::mutex d_mutex;
    std::condition_variable d_condition;
    size_t d_nAvailable;
        
</pre>

 implement <code>Semaphore::wait</code> as a member template accepting a function
(object) and the function's arguments as its argument. This <code>wait</code> member
should return a <code>bool</code>, and it must block until it has obtained the
Semaphore's mutex lock. Then, while its <code>d_available</code> value equals 0, it
waits until being notified.  Once it has re-acquired the lock after being
notified the provided function is called, receiving <code>wait</code>'s perfectly
forwarded remaining arguments.  This member returns <code>false</code> if the called
function returns <code>false</code>. It returns <code>true</code> if the function returns
<code>true</code> and <code>d_available</code> was unequal zero (following the function's
<code>true</code> return. 
<p>
In the original implementation a <code>std::function</code> had to be used to handle
functions, function objects and lambda functions, but your implementation
should not depend on <code>std::function</code>. The template type parameter that's
used for this implementation should be able to handle functions, function
objects and lambda functions, but should not be defined as a
<code>std::function</code>. 
</p><p>
Submit the implementation of the <code>bool wait</code> member, and insert the
function's declaration at the indicated position in the following (partial)
interface:
</p><p>
</p><pre>
    class Semaphore
    {
        ...
        public:

        // declare bool wait here

        ...
    };

</pre>

<p>
<br><br>
</p><p>
              
       
        
            </p><hr>
            <strong>Exercise 3.</strong>
            <br>
            Purpose of this exercise: learn to use <code>back_inserter</code> with a home-made
class
<p>
Consider the following class skeleton:
</p><p>
</p><pre>
    class Data
    {
        typedef std::vector&lt;std::shared_ptr&lt;std::string&gt;&gt; DataVector;

        DataVector d_data;

        public:
            // declare push_back here
    };
        
</pre>

    Objects of the class <code>Data</code> store pointer to lines in the vector
<code>d_data</code>, and provide a <code>push_back</code> member to fill the object with lines
of text.
<p>
Implement <code>push_back</code> and show how the <code>copy</code> generic algorithm can be
used to fill a <code>Data</code> object with lines read from an <code>istream</code>. 
</p><p>
Submit the interface of the <code>class Data</code>, the implementation of
<code>push_back</code> and a demo program showing its use in combination with the
<code>copy</code> generic algorithm.
</p><p>
<br><br>
</p><p>
              
       
        
            </p><hr>
            <strong>Exercise 4.</strong>
            <br>
            Purpose of this exercise: learn to convert an existing class into a class
template.
<p>
Part II contained an exercise about a multi-threaded version of
<code>qsort</code>. The multi-threaded version of <code>qsort</code> was introduced as follows:
</p><p>
</p><p></p><hr><p>
</p><p>
Consider the following raw outline of the qsort algorithm:
        </p><pre>
    qsort(begin, end)
    {
        mid = partition(begin, end);

        qsort(begin, mid);
        qsort(mid, end);
    }
        
</pre>

    In the multithreaded variant the recursive calls are implemented as
threads, but they operate completely independently from each other. Our
implementation will not do recursion and will not start new
threads. Instead, we pre-define a number of worker threads, performing the
following tasks:
        <pre>
    wait for a notification that the next range to partition might be 
                                                                available
    if it isn't, then done: notify the other threads and stop
    it it is available:
        retrieve it -&gt; begin, end
        partition it: mid = partition(begin, end);
        if the range begin..mid contains multiple elements (i.e., mid - begin
            &gt; 1) then put begin, mid on the queue containing ranges waiting to
            be processed  and notifiy other threads
        if the range mid..end contains multiple elements (i.e., end - mid
            &gt; 1) then put mid, end on the queue containing ranges waiting to
            be processed and notifiy other threads
        
</pre>

    Initially the queue is filled with begin, end, indicating the full range
of elements to sort, and the semaphore <code>nextRange</code> is initialized with the
value 1.
<p>
Implement this version of qsort using a main thread and three additional
sorting threads. 
</p><p>
Assuming an <code>int ia[]</code> array and its number of elements (in
<code>iaSize</code>) are available, your <code>main</code> function should look like this:
        </p><pre>
    int main()
    {
        nextRange.push(Pair{ia, ia + iaSize});  // initialize the queue
    
        thread t1(tsort);                       // start the threads
        thread t2(tsort);
        thread t3(tsort);
    
        t1.join();                              // clean up
        t2.join();       
        t3.join();       
        t3.join();       
    
        for (int val: ia)                       // show the sorted array
            cout &lt;&lt; val &lt;&lt; ' ';
        cout &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
        
</pre>
    
<p></p><hr><p>
</p><p>
The version of <code>qsort</code> to be developed here implements this algorithm as a
template. The above <code>main</code> function should then look like this:
        </p><pre>
    int main()
    {
        // define some sortable data structure, e.g., a vector:
        vector&lt;SomeType&gt; data;

                                                // tsort has the same
                                                // signatures as STL's sort
                                                // algorithm
        tsort(data.begin(), data.end() [, optComparator]);

        // display data's value using any available method
    }
        
</pre>

    Internally, <code>tsort</code> should pass its arguments to a class template
<code>TSort</code> implementing the multithreaded qsort method using three sorting
threads (comparable to the three threads used in the above (first) 
<code>main</code> function). All the required functionality for the sorting process
should be embedded in the class <code>TSort</code>.
<p>
(At this point our implementation of the non-templated implementation 
cannot yet be made available, as the deadline of that exercises has not yet
been reached).
</p><p>
<br><br>
</p><p>
              
       
        
            </p><hr>
            <strong>Exercise 5.</strong>
            <br>
            Purpose of this exercise: learn to design static polymorphic classes
<p>
Design a static polymorphic base class supporting insertion. The class has no
public members, but an <code>operator&lt;&lt;</code> function should be declared as its
friend, calling the base class's member <code>insertInto(std::ostream &amp;)</code>. This
latter member, in turn, calls <code>insertInto</code> as defined by any classes derived
from <code>Base</code>. 
</p><p>
To get you on the right track, the function <code>operator&lt;&lt;</code> is defined like
this:
        </p><pre>
    template &lt;typename Derived&gt;
    std::ostream &amp;operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream &amp;out, Base&lt;Derived&gt; const &amp;base)
    {
        return base.insertInto(out);
    }
        
</pre>

<p>
Derive classes <code>IntValue</code> and <code>DoubleValue</code> from <code>Base</code>, and show how
you can insert the values stored in these classes, defining <code>insertInto</code> as
their private members, and calling <code>operator&lt;&lt;</code> for objects of these classes
in <code>main</code>.
</p><p>
Submit the implementation of <code>Base, IntValue, DoubleValue</code> and a small
<code>main</code> function showing how you used the developed statically polymorphic
classes. 
</p><p>
<br><br>
</p><p>
              
       
        
            </p><hr>
            <strong>Exercise 6.</strong>
            <br>
            (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: learn to create a generic constructor for a virtual
base class
<p>
Consider the situation where a abstract base class (ABC) defines a purely
abstract member <code>void run()</code>. The ABC could look like this:
        </p><pre>
    class ABC
    {
        public:
            virtual ~ABC();

            void interface();       // calls run

        private:
            virtual void run() = 0;
    };
        
</pre>

<p>
Another class (e.g., <code>class Process</code>) has a constructor defining  a
reference to a temporary <code>ABC</code>. Its members may call the <code>ABC's interface</code>
function, and thus the function <code>run</code>, as implemented in classes derived
from <code>ABC</code>. 
</p><p>
The <code>class Process</code> could look like this:
        </p><pre>
    class Process
    {
        ABC &amp;&amp;d_abc;

        public:
            Process(ABC &amp;&amp;abc);
            void execute();         // calls d_abc.interface()
    };
        
</pre>

<p>
Assume classes <code>Derived1</code> and <code>Derived2</code> are derived from
<code>ABC</code>. <code>Derived1's</code> constructor defines a <code>std::ostream &amp;</code> parameter,
<code>Derived2's</code> constructor a <code>std::istream &amp;</code> and a <code>std::ostream &amp;</code>
parameter. 
</p><p>
Part 1:
</p><p>
How would you define <code>Process</code> in <code>main</code>? If <code>main</code> is called with one
argument <code>Derived1</code> should be passed to <code>Process's</code> constructor (passing
cerr) to <code>Derived1</code>; otherwise <code>Derived2</code> should be passed (passing
<code>cin</code> and <code>cout</code> to <code>Derived2</code>.
</p><p>
In <code>main</code> you get something like this:
        </p><pre>
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        Process process{
                    argc == 1 ? Derived1{ cerr } : Derived2{ cin, cout }
                };
        // etc.
    }
        
</pre>

    The problem with the above piece of code is that it doesn't flawlessly
compile. Solve that problem without altering <code>main's</code> design.
<p>
Part 2:
</p><p>
To solve the problem in a generic way (i.e., usable for any class derived from
<code>ABC</code>) the class <code>ABC</code> could define a static member <code>make</code>, which not
only can be used for any derived class, but also for any set of parameters
that might ever be required by those derived classes.
</p><p>
Using this member template the above function <code>main</code> would then look like
this:
        </p><pre>
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        Process process{
                    argc == 1 ? 
                    ABC::make&lt;Derived1&gt;(cerr) : 
                    ABC::make&lt;Derived2&gt;(cin, cout)
                };
        // etc.
    }
        
</pre>

    Define the member template <code>ABC::make</code> so that it can be used as shown.
Also show its declaration in the class <code>ABC</code>.
<p>
<br><br>
</p><p>
              
       
        
            </p><hr>
            <strong>Exercise 7.</strong>
            <br>
            (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: learn to design static polymorphic classes using
                          multiple layers of inheritance.
<p>
This exercise may earn you 2 points.
</p><p>
Starting from the statically polymorphic class setup described in the previous
exercise, derive a class <code>LabelledInt</code> from <code>IntValue</code>. <code>LabelledInt</code>
expects a piece of text (the label) and an <code>int</code> value (stored in its
<code>IntValue</code> base class). 
</p><p>
When a <code>LabelledInt</code> object is inserted into an <code>ostream</code> using
<code>operator&lt;&lt;</code> developed in the previous exercise, it should print the label,
followed by the int-value (of course, you need to allow access to
<code>IntValue's int</code> value from <code>LabelledInt</code>: just define a simple accessor
for this).
</p><p>
<br><br>
</p><p>
              
       
        
            </p><hr>
            <strong>Exercise 8.</strong>
            <br>
            (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: learn to add iterators to a class.
<p>
Consider the following class:
        </p><pre>
    template &lt;typename Data&gt;
    class Storage
    {
        std::vector&lt;Data *&gt; d_storage;

        public:
            // the usual stuff goes here

    };
        
</pre>

    The `usual stuff' are members allowing you to initialize a <code>Storage</code>,
add <code>Data</code> objects to it, maybe remove elements, request elements,
etc. etc., all of which are not required for this exercise. The essential part
here is that the elements of <code>d_storage</code> should point to newly allocated
<code>Data</code> values, allocated by <code>Storage</code>, using <code>Data</code> arguments that are
passed to the various member functions.
<p>
For this exercise provide <code>Storage</code> with <code>Storage&lt;Data&gt;::iterator
begin(), Storage&lt;Data&gt;::iterator end(), Storage&lt;Data&gt;::reverse_iterator
begin()</code>, and <code>Storage&lt;Data&gt;::reverse_iterator rend()</code> members: submit their
implementations and the implementations of the <code>iterator</code> and
<code>reverse_iterator</code> classes.
</p><p>
The provided implementation should allow you to do this:
        </p><pre>
    int main()
    {
        Storage&lt;std::string&gt; storage;

        sort(storage.begin(), storage.end());
        sort(storage.rbegin(), storage.rend());
    }
        
</pre>

    where <code>sort</code> is the sorting function provided by the STL.
<p>
<br><br>
</p><p>
              
       
        
            </p><hr>
            <strong>Exercise 9.</strong>
            <br>
            (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: learn to widen the use of range-based for-loops.
<p>
In this exercise develop the <code>RBFL</code> (Range Based For Loop) class template,
and the <code>rbfl</code> function template.
</p><p>
The <code>RBFL</code> class template defines ranges that can be used with range-based
for-loops. The standard range-based for-loop requires for its
range-specificiation an array or an iterator range as offered by, e.g.,
containers (through their <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> members.  Ranges defined by a
pair of pointers or by a subrange defined by iterator expressions cannot
currently be used in combination with range-based for-loops.
</p><p>
<code>RBFL</code> extends the applicability of range-based  for-loops  by  turning
pairs of pointers, an initial pointer and a pointer count, or a pair of
iterators into a range that can be used by range-based for-loops.
</p><p>
<code>RBFL</code> is a class template requiring one template type parameter:
<code>Iterator</code>, an iterator or pointer type reaching the data when dereferenced.
</p><p>
<code>RBFL</code>'s  users don't have to specify <code>RBFL</code>'s template type, as the 
function template <code>rbfl</code> returns the appropriate <code>RBFL</code> object.
</p><p>
The <code>rbfl</code> function template may be called as follows:
    </p><ul>
       <li> <code>rbfl(Iterator const &amp;begin, Iterator const &amp;end)</code>:
              this function template returns a <code>RBFL</code> object for the
              (sub)range defined by two (reverse) iterators;
<p>
</p></li><li> <code>rbfl(Iterator const &amp;begin, size_t count)</code>:
              this function template returns a <code>RBFL</code> object for the
              (sub)range  defined  by  the  (reverse) iterator range 
                <code>begin</code> and <code>begin + count</code>;
<p>
</p></li><li> <code>RBFL&lt;Data *&gt; rbfl(Data *begin, Data *end)</code>:
              this function template returns a <code>RBFL</code> object for the
              (sub)range defined by the two pointers <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code>;
<p>
</p></li><li> <code>RBFL&lt;Data *&gt; rbfl(Data *begin, size_t count)</code>:
              this function template returns a <code>RBFL</code> object for the
              (sub)range defined by the two pointers 
                <code>begin</code> and <code>begin + count</code>.
        </li></ul>
<p>
The <code>RBFL</code> class template itself offers but one constructor:
        </p><pre>
    RBFL(Iterator const &amp;begin, Iterator const &amp;end)
        
</pre>

<p>
Submit the class template, the function templates, and a small demo function
