Pascal allows us to write values of multiple variables using its write function
WRITE: a function expecting one or more variable names or numbers, separated by commas

Define the grammar recognizing series of write function calls (maybe none at all).

Assume that the lexical scanner knows about WRITE, IDENT and NUMBER tokens. 

PASCAL:
write ('a=',a); prints "a=" on the screen and then prints the contents of the a variable.
