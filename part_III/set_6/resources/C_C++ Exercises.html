<h1>Chapter 6: Exercises set six: Parsers part I: Grammars 
                             (Deadline Mar 29).</h1>
<p>
In the following exercises we're constructing several small
    grammars. The actual grammar processing is covered in next
    week's lecture.
</p><p>
When submitting your work, please make sure that your grammar can be
    properly processed by a parser generator (in practice: <strong>bisonc++</strong>). That
    parser generator produces output to the standard error stream when it
    detects errors or produces warnings. You should make sure with every
    grammar that the parser generator did not issue error and/or warning
    messages.
</p><p>
In all cases, submit your parser generator's input <strong>s</strong>, defining the
    grammar. Also, make sure that your parser doesn't do things a lexical
    scanner is supposed to handle. Be realistic: complex input should be
    handled by the parser, the lexical scanner should only do basic lexical
    scanning. Also, all grammars required for the exercises are fairly
    small. Pay attention to grammar design, and stick to the standard building
    blocks.  
</p><p>
We won't be able to help you solving problems with grammars that aren't
    gobbled by the parser generator and that do not use standard building
    blocks.
</p><p>
By default the <strong>bisonc++</strong> generator generates a parser class
    <code>`Parser'</code>, having by default a member function <code>int parse</code>. If
    you want to test the parser by interfacing it to a scanner, the
    following is suggested: 
        </p><ul> 
            <li> Start the parser specification file's preamble with the
            following lines: 
            <pre> 
        %class-name Parser 
        %filenames parser 
        %parsefun-source parse.cc
        %scanner ../scanner/scanner.h 
            
</pre>
 
            </li><li> Define the scanner class in the indicated subdirectory 
            </li><li> Include the file <code>../parser/parserbase.h</code> in the lexer 
            specification file, and let the scanner return
            <code>Parser::TOKENNAME</code> tokens.   
        </li></ul> 
<p>
<br><br>
</p><p>
              
       
        
            </p><hr>
            <strong>Exercise 38.</strong>
            <br>
            Purpose: learn to specify a simple grammar
<p>
In a language like <strong>C</strong> and <strong>C++</strong> functions may be defined accepting
multiple arguments using ellipses (<code>...</code>). In languages like <strong>Pascal</strong>
that is not allowed. <strong>Pascal</strong>, however, allows us to write values of
multiple variables using its <code>write</code> function, which is a function
expecting one or more variable names or numbers, separated by commas. Define
the grammar recognizing series of <code>write</code>
function calls (maybe none at all).
</p><p>
Assume that the lexical scanner knows about <code>WRITE</code>, <code>IDENT</code> and
<code>NUMBER</code> tokens.
</p><p>
<br><br>
</p><p>
              
       
        
            </p><hr>
            <strong>Exercise 39.</strong>
            <br>
            Purpose: define the grammar of a simple calculator
<p>
A simple algebraic calculator operates on <code>double</code> values and performs
multiplications, divisions, additions, subtractions, negations and also
allows you to use parentheses. Often such a calculator supports <code>sqrt</code>
computations for which an <em>operator</em> could be defined (e.g., <code>$</code> could be
the square-root operator, allowing for expressions like
        </p><pre>
    2 * $ 4 + 2 * -6
        
</pre>

    resulting in the value -8.
<p>
Define the grammar allowing you to enter expressions matching such a
grammar. Make sure the preamble only specifies tokens that can actually be
returned by the parser (to be specific: a token <code>UMINUS</code> is not required,
even though the grammar must offer a unary minus operator). 
</p><p>
Hint: this final requirement is very easy to satisfy. Don't look for
complex solutions.
</p><p>
<br><br>
</p><p>
              
       
        
            </p><hr>
            <strong>Exercise 40.</strong>
            <br>
            Purpose: learn to solve conflicts occurring in a grammar
<p>
Explain why the following grammar has conflicts and solve the conflicts so
that the repaired grammar accepts expressions consisting of numbers, addition
and subtraction operators where the priorities of the operators are equal.
</p><p>
When the conflicts are <em>not</em> explicitly solved, the parser generator
`solves' the conflicts for you. Submit a (second) grammar explicitly showing
how the conflicts are solved in the way the parser generator solves them,
without the parser generator reporting any conflicts (Hint: this may require
you to remove a rule).
</p><p>
</p><pre>
    %token NUMBER
    
    %%

    expr:
        NUMBER
    |
        number
    |
        expr '+' expr
    |
        expr '-' expr
    ;

    number:
        NUMBER
    ;
         
</pre>

<p>
<br><br>
</p><p>
              
       
        
            </p><hr>
            <strong>Exercise 41.</strong>
            <br>
            Purpose: learn to add a new priority level to a grammar
<p>
The following grammar supports addition, multiplication and negation:
        </p><pre>
    %token NR
    %left '+'
    %left '*'
    %right '-'

    %%

    expr:
        NR
    |
        '-' expr
    |
        expr '+' expr
    |
        expr '*' expr
    ;
        
</pre>

    The test for inequality (written as <code>!=</code>) has a priority below the
priority of the addition operator; an operator <code>'^'</code> could be defined as the
binary exponentiation operator having priority exceeding multiplication but
lower than negation. 
<p>
Expand the grammar in such a way that these two operators are also
supported by the grammar. Submit the new parser generator input file.
</p><p>
<br><br>
</p><p>
              
       
        
            </p><hr>
            <strong>Exercise 42.</strong>
            <br>
            Purpose: provide a grammar with an index operator
<p>
The following grammar supports addition, multiplication and negation:
        </p><pre>
    %token VAR
    %token NR
    %left '+'
    %left '*'
    %right '-'

    %%

    expr:
        NR
    |
        VAR
    |
        '-' expr
    |
        expr '+' expr
    |
        expr '*' expr
    ;
        
</pre>

    Assume that a variable (VAR) can also be an array having an unspecified
number of dimensions. So, expressions like
        <pre>
    a[3][4] + b[c]
        
</pre>

    are in principle possible, but expressions like
        <pre>
    3[4]
        
</pre>

    are probably not allowed, although grammatically correct.
<p>
When confronted with the request to add the index operator, but it is as
yet not possible to state whether <code>3[4], 4[a],</code> etc. are allowed or not, how
would you modify the above grammar so that index operations are recognized by
the parser? Realize that the number of dimensions is left unspecified. 
</p><p>
Hint: an index operation is itself part of an expression and that expression
defines an expression by itself. 
</p><p>
<br><br>
</p><p>
              
       
        
            </p><hr>
            <strong>Exercise 43.</strong>
            <br>
            (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: learn to repair a defective grammar
<p>
In the slides the wordlist grammar having one R/R conflict was discussed. Its
original form was:
        </p><pre>
    list:
        plain
    |
        separated
    ;

    plain:
        plain
        WORD
    |
        WORD
    ;

    separated:
        separated
        ','
        WORD
    |
        WORD
    ;
        
</pre>

    The grammar author's intent was to define a grammar allowing input of
the forms
        <pre>
    word word word word 
        
</pre>

    (etc, i.e., one or more words not separated by commas), or:
        <pre>
    word, word, word, word 
        
</pre>

    (etc, i.e. one or more words separated by commas).
<p>
The `solution' provided by the slides in fact is not a solution of the
original problem as it defines an <em>optional</em> separator, allowing lists of
the form:
        </p><pre>
    word word, word, word word
        
</pre>

<p>
Repair the orgininal grammar by defining a grammar that accepts one or more
words where <em>either</em> all words are separated by a comma or the separator is
used nowhere at all. Submit the grammar specification file, using the terminal
token WORD to represent a word. According to the grammar there must be at
least a single WORD. What modification is required to make that initial word
optional as well?
</p><p>
If the problem described so far is solved by your solution, you'll receive one point.
However, the solution most often handed in has a problem: it turns ugly. It does
that as soon as an element of a wordlist or commalist may not only be a WORD,
but also some other token, perhaps an INT or a FLOAT.
</p><p>
So a valid input in that case might be: </p><pre>
   foo bar 3.14 1 0 baz

</pre>

<p>
If your solution remains elegant and short in the face of that change, you
receive two points. It is the structure of the grammar that counts in this
regard. Whether it actually defines multiple tokens is not relevant.
</p><p>
<br><br>
</p><p>

            <strong>Exercise 44.</strong>
            <br>
            (optional)<br>Purpose of this exercise: design an interactive program.
<p>
(You can receive 3 points for this exercise)
</p><p>
In statistics, normal distributions are characterized by their means and
standard deviations. Given a normal distribution, observations can be
associated with positions in these normal distributions. The formula to
compute these positions is <code>z = (x - m) / s</code>, where <code>x</code> is the
observation, <code>m</code> the mean, and <code>s</code> the standard deviation.
</p><p>
In this exercise, we designing an interactive program built around these
normal distribution (but not actually using them) where commands are
entered on lines, which command in a full-blown program would be handled by,
e.g. a <code>NormalDistribution</code> object. 
</p><p>
When the program starts, each line begins with a prompt (i.e.: 
`<code>(? )'</code>. Commands are:
    </p><ul>
    <li> An empty line: the program ends;
    </li><li> <code>m mean</code>, mean being a double value. This sets a new mean for the
        <code>NormDist</code> object;
    </li><li> <code>s stddev</code>, stddev being a double value. This sets a new std. deviation
        for the <code>NormDist</code> object;
    </li><li> <code>score</code>, score being a double value. This returns the z-score for
        <code>score</code>, given the current mean and std. dev.;
    </li><li> <code>score nObs</code>, score being a double value, nObs being a positive
        integral value. This returns the z-score for
        <code>score</code>, given the current mean and std. dev. and the number of
        observations <code>nObs</code>.
    </li></ul>
    The format for double values is simplified to
    <ul>
    <li> Integral values (decimal digits), optionally starting with a minus
        character, optionally followed by a dot, which is optionally followed
        by a fraction (consisting of decimal digits).
    </li><li> a dot, optionally starting with a minus character, followed by
        a fraction. 
    </li></ul>
<p>
For now, no actions are performed by the program, except for ending the
program at an empty line. In that case, add the action block
        </p><pre>
    {
        ACCEPT();
    }
        
</pre>

    to the rule matching the empty line.
<p>
Submit <code>main.cc, main.ih</code>, the scanner's lexer specification and the
parser's grammar specification.
</p><p>
Caveat: In your program only once a <code>cout &lt;&lt; "? ";</code> statement may be
used. Embedding the statement in a function and calling that function multiple
times also counts as multiple uses of the <code>cout</code> statement. You <em>may</em>
define a prompt rule, though:
        </p><pre>
    prompt:
        {
            std::cout &lt;&lt; "? ";      // or 'cout', when using namespace std
        }
    ;
        
</pre>

<p>
Another way to use a single <code>cout</code> consists of slightly modifying the
parser's <code>lex</code> function. You get two points when providing two
implementations using a single <code>cout</code> statement: one by merely defining
grammar rules, one by defining grammar rules not containing a <code>cout</code>
statement, but using a modification of the parser's <code>lex</code> function. 
</p><p>
In fact, there is a third way to realize a single <code>cout</code> statement. You earn
three points if you submit all three implementations.
