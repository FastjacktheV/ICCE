General:
    Prefer .ih over .h

    include iostream, string, etc in header file
    include header file in each source
    
    each method couts that it is method x, maybe nicer
    to do this from main in a single cout statement (?).
    
    
method6.cc
    prefer while(true) over while(1)
    CTR on line 26
    whitespace before else line 26
    Break on line 36 does nothing

main.cc 
     Why is valueToAnalyze passed as a constant? 
    
method3.cc 
    Break on line 36 does nothing
