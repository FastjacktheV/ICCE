<h1 >Chapter 1: Introduction</h1>
<strong >Bisonc++</strong> is a general-purpose parser generator converting grammar descriptions for
LALR(1) context-free grammars into <strong >C++</strong> classes whose members can parse
such grammars.  Once you are a proficient <strong >bisonc++</strong> user, you may use it to develop
a wide range of language parsers, from those used in simple desk calculators
to complex programming languages.
<p>
<strong >Bisonc++</strong> is highly comparable to the program bison++, written by Alain Coetmeur:
all properly-written bison++ grammars ought to be convertible to <strong >bisonc++</strong> grammars
requiring very little or no modifications.  Anyone familiar with bison++ or
its precursor, bison, should quickly be able to use <strong >bisonc++</strong> as well. <strong >Bisonc++</strong>
generates <strong >C++</strong> code, rather than <strong >C</strong> code, and so a fair knowledge of the
<strong >C++</strong> programming language is required before <strong >bisonc++</strong> can profitably be used.
<p>
This manual closely resembles <strong >bison</strong>(1)'s userguide. In fact, many sections
of that manual were copied straight into this manual. With <strong >bisonc++</strong> distributions
(both the full source distribution and the binary <code >.deb</code> distributions)
<strong >bison</strong>'s orginal manual is included in both <em >PostScript</em> and (converted
from the <code >texi</code> format) <code >HTML</code> format. Where necessary sections of the
original manual were adapted to <strong >bisonc++</strong>'s characteristics. Some sections were
removed, and some new sections were added to the current manual. Expect
upgrades of the manual to appear without further notice. Upgrades will be
announced in the manual's title.
<p>
The current manual starts with tutorial chapters that explain the basic
concepts of using <strong >bisonc++</strong> and use three examples illustrating some of the core
issues of LALR(1) grammars, each example building on the previous example
(where available).  If you don't know <strong >bisonc++</strong>, bison++ or bison, start by reading
these chapters.  Reference chapters follow describing specific aspects of <strong >bisonc++</strong>
in detail.
<p>
<strong >Bisonc++</strong> was designed and built by <a href="mailto:f.b.brokken@rug.nl">Frank
B. Brokken</a>. The program's first version was 
constructed between November 2004 and May 2005.

<h2 >1.1: What's new in version 6.01.03</h2>
    If you're new to <strong >bisonc++</strong>, you can safely skip this section. If you used <strong >bisonc++</strong>
before, please note the following new and modified features:
    <ul>
   <li> The generated code was redesigned. Large parts of the protected
    interface of the parser's base class and names of <code >parse()</code>-related
    members in the generated parser class were modified. The names of all
    accessible members in <code >parserbase.h</code> and <code >parser.h</code> now have two
    trailing underscore characters.  Predefined members in <code >parser.ih</code> no
    longer have trailing underscores, and can be redefined (but must be
    available).  The traditional <code >error(char const *)</code> member in fact never
    uses its argument (and <strong >bisonc++</strong> only passes the default "Syntax error"
    argument). Its prototype now no longer defines a parameter.  Here's an
    overview of modified member names/signatures:

<p>
When re-generating parsers generated by <strong >bisonc++</strong> before version 6.00.00,
    the signatures of the above functions in the file parser.h must be
    hand-modified to reflect the above changes. In addition, the
    implementations of error and exceptionHandler (default implementations
    were provided in parser.ih) must be adapted to their new signatures.
<p>
<li> Added a warning to <code >skeletons/binsonc++.h</code> that until the <code >#undef</code>
    instruction the parser class name will be read as the parser's base class
    name. 
<p>
<li> With Polymorphic semantic values a tag mismatch is no considered fatal
    anymore if errors were already encountered. In that case the semantic
    value showing a tag mismatch is replaced by the default value of the
    semantic value of the expected polymorphic type.
<p>
<li> Added option and directive <code >--prompt</code> (<code >%prompt</code>): when debug-code
    is active, the generated parser shows a ?-prompt at each cycle when
    processing its input (which should not be provided on the standard input
    stream).
<p>
<li> Option <code >--thread-safe</code> can now also be specified as a
    directive (<code >%thread-safe</code>).
<p>
<li> Members that should not be modified by the parser class were moved to
    the parser's base class's private section. Accessor members are now
    available in the parser's base class, allowing user code to read, e.g.,
    the currently active token and parsing state.
